{"question": "Is it likely for a baby to go back into a breech position while swimming?", "answer": "Reasoning: Rigorous exercise may result in changes to fetal position in the uterus. Fetal position changes easily during pregnancy. Fetal position changes become less frequent as pregnancy progresses. Breech position is a specific position of the baby in the uterus. It is safe to swim while pregnant. Exercise in general and swimming in particular may affect fetal position. Exercise in pregnancy may have benefits. The position and lie of a baby in utero can change easily and frequently during pregnancy.\nAnswer: No evidence-based data exists that swimming in a swimming pool is effective to turn a baby's position inside the womb. Many healthcare providers and fitness professionals recommend swimming as one of the safest exercises for pregnant women as it keeps the body toned without adding weight and stress to the joints and raises the heart rate without the risk of tripping falling. Almost all babies are breech at some point during pregnancy, and nothing has been shown to prevent a baby from turning to a breech position. Most babies will naturally move to a head-down position by 36 weeks of pregnancy. If your baby presents in a breech position after 36 weeks, speak to your healthcare provider to discuss safe delivery options. Trying to turn a baby may not be a safe option for some high-risk pregnancies."}
{"question": "When do babies no longer need formula or breastmilk?", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be a specific age at which a baby should no longer receive formula or breast milk. There is a point at which a baby may no longer receive adequate nutrition from formula or breast milk. Convenience for the mother/caretaker may play a role in determining when to stop formula or breast milk. It is possible to harm a baby by feeding formula or breast milk for too long. Formula or breast milk only provide benefits to a baby up to a certain age.\nAnswer: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends feeding babies only breast milk for the first six months of life. After that, they recommend a combination of solid foods and breast milk until a baby is at least one year old. If a baby is weaned from breastmilk before the age of 12 months, formula should be given instead in place of breastmilk until the age of one. A baby should continue with formula after one year in certain circumstances such as when the baby is not gaining weight, if the baby was born prematurely, when a balanced solid food diet has not been established, if the baby has an underlying health condition or food allergy, or based on a doctor's recommendation. Most experts agree that breastfeeding should continue for as long as it suits mother and baby. The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for the first two years of a child's life. When to wean a baby is a personal decision and will be different for everyone. It can be influenced by many factors including the mother's return to work, the health of mother and baby, and simply a feeling that the time is right."}
{"question": "Can a baby develop structural abnormalities after the 20 week scan?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are structural abnormalities that can occur in babies. The 20 week scan evaluates for certain structural abnormalities. It is possible for an ultrasonographer to miss structural abnormalities during a 20 week scan. There are structural abnormalities that can develop after 20 weeks.\nAnswer: During pregnancy, the major structures of the body form in the first trimester, or before 14 weeks of gestation. These include the spine, head, arms, and legs. The organs also develop, such as the heart, stomach, lungs, brain, and central nervous system. By 20 weeks of gestation, the majority of structural development in the fetus has already occurred, and abnormalities can be detected on an ultrasound. In general, major abnormalities of the body and internal organs are more likely to develop between five to 14 weeks of gestation. Once a body part has formed, it is no longer at risk to develop major birth defects although its growth and/or function could still be affected after it has formed. Also, some organs continue to develop past the first trimester until birth, such as the lungs, the brain, central nervous system, and eyes. It is also important to note that a 20-week ultrasound doesn't find all congenital conditions that could already be present. It can help detect several serious conditions and major developmental problems. Some conditions exist that will not be known until the baby is born. For example, many heart abnormalities are not found until birth. Additionally, the scan results are not a formal diagnosis of any health condition but indicate further tests are needed."}
{"question": "When is it safe to start co-sleeping with my baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: Co-sleeping with a baby has risks and benefits. There is a way to lessen the risks of co-sleeping. The risks of co-sleeping may diminish after a certain age. Co-sleeping is a desireable thing for the baby and the mother.\nAnswer: Many people use the terms “bed-sharing” and “co-sleeping” to describe the same thing. Co-sleeping is when a parent and child sleep in close social or physical contact of each other. Room-sharing and bed-sharing are types of co-sleeping. Sharing an adult bed with a baby, known as bed-sharing, increases the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, suffocation, and other sleep-related infant deaths. The risks are especially high in infants younger than four months, preterm infants, and babies with low birth weight. Because of the risks involved, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) warns against bed-sharing. The AAP understands and respects that many parents choose to routinely bed share for a variety of reasons; however, on the basis of evidence, the AAP is unable to recommend bed sharing under any circumstances. Instead, the AAP recommends room-sharing with baby for at least the first six months. Room sharing means baby has his or her own sleep space such as a crib, bassinet, or portable play yard, in the parent's room but separate from the parent's bed. Room-sharing without bed sharing is protective for the first year of life. If parents prefer to move baby to another bedroom, it is best to wait until the baby is at least six months old."}
{"question": "Is it bad if my 5 week old baby falls asleep after feeding in the daytime?", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be risks associated with a baby falling asleep after feeding in the daytime. There may be a specific period of time that a baby should remain awake after feeding. There are ways to prevent a baby from falling asleep during or after feeding. There is a danger to falling asleep after feeding. The danger may be different depending on the age of the baby.\nAnswer: In the first few months of life, it is practically impossible to keep a nursing baby awake who is satisfied with a full belly. Generally, newborns sleep a total of about eight to nine hours in the daytime so several daytime naps are normal for a young baby. Because they have small stomachs, they must wake to eat about every three hours, and it is common for newborns and younger infants to fall asleep while feeding."}
{"question": "What is the best way to keep a newborn warm on very cold winter walks?", "answer": "Reasoning: Winter walks may or may not be good for a baby and there may be a need to avoid them. It is important to keep the baby warm during winter walks. There may be a temperature below which it is too cold to take a baby for a walk. There are different fabrics and types of clothing that can be used to keep a baby warm during a winter walk. There are signs that can indicate if the baby is getting too cold.\nAnswer: Newborn babies need to be protected from exposure to cold weather and developing hypothermia and frostbite. To keep baby warm, dress baby in several layers of light clothing such as a cotton snap-bottom shirt and a fleece sleeper. Then button baby up in a polyester or down-filled bunting, and wrap baby in a blanket if needed. A hat should totally cover the ears and fasten under the chin so it won't fall off. Avoid clothing or boots that are too tight because poor circulation can contribute to frostbite. Placing baby in a front carrier inside your coat can help block wind and cold air, but make sure baby's mouth and nose are not obstructed. Keep in mind, if you're carrying your baby or baby is riding in a stroller, then he or she is not moving around enough to generate much body heat. Infants lose heat from their skin more quickly than do adults so keep neighborhood walks or treks to and from the car short. An infant should not be out in the cold for extended periods of time. Be particularly cautious on cold, windy days because wind makes the skin lose heat faster. Check often for signs of frostbite such as whitening of the skin, which usually appears first on extremities and areas that are most exposed to wind and cold. Check baby's face, ears, fingers, and toes frequently, even if you think baby is wearing plenty of clothing. Once indoors, remove layers promptly to avoid overheating. Also remove wet clothes immediately because moisture draws heat away from skin."}
{"question": "How quickly is my milk supply affected if I have to be away from my 3.5 month old for 8 hours?", "answer": "Reasoning: Active breastfeeding results in ongoing milk production. Milk production may decrease soon after the last breastfeeding session. The age of the baby may have an impact on milk production. There may be problems with milk production when away from the baby for an extended period of time. Milk production may decrease rapidly after each feeding session.\nAnswer: Long periods of time between nursing or pumping sessions can slowly reduce your milk supply. The more you delay nursing or pumping, the less milk your body will make because overfilled or engorged breasts send a signal to your brain that you need to make less milk. Breast fullness usually starts to decrease in one to three days, but it commonly takes several days or weeks for breasts to completely stop making milk. If you're away from your baby for long stretches during the day, pump or hand express every three hours to maintain your supply."}
{"question": "Is it possible to be diagnosed with PPD at 12 weeks postpartum?", "answer": "Reasoning: PPD can be diagnosed at 12 weeks postpartum. PPD is more likely to occur during the first few months after delivery. There may be signs and symptoms of PPD that are easier to detect at 12 weeks compared to earlier or later in the postpartum period. PPD can be missed by doctors or midwives.\nAnswer: Symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD) usually develop within the first few weeks after giving birth. Extensive data suggest the onset of postpartum disorders occur within the first month after childbirth. In some cases, parents don't begin to feel depressed until several weeks, months, or even up to a year after giving birth. If left untreated, PPD may last for many months or longer. PPD is different from the “baby blues,” which usually begin during the first two to three days after delivery and last for up to two weeks. With PPD, the symptoms are more intense and last longer. The optimal time to screen for PPD is at the first postnatal obstetrical visit, which is often at 4-6 weeks after delivery. Diagnosis may be delayed if parents with symptoms of PPD are reluctant or embarrassed to speak to their healthcare provider at their first postpartum appointment. If you have symptoms that suggest you have PPD, speak with your primary health care provider as soon as possible to begin treatment."}
{"question": "How often should I bathe my newborn and infant?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a perfect interval between baths for newborns and infants. Bathing too frequently or too infrequently can cause problems. The potential harms of bathing too frequently or too infrequently vary depending on the baby's age. There is a way to know when my baby needs a bath.\nAnswer: A newborn baby does not need a bath every day. Three times a week might be enough until baby becomes more mobile. Bathing a baby too much can dry out his or her skin. Often baby's face and neck are already getting cleaned during feedings, and the diaper area is getting cleaned during diaper changes. Between baths, check the folds of baby's skin including thighs, groin, armpits, and under the chin. If needed, clean these areas with a wet washcloth and dry thoroughly."}
{"question": "Is it normal for newborns to have dry skin on their face?", "answer": "Reasoning: Dry skin on a newborn's face can have different causes. There are some reasons for dry skin on a newborn's face that are benign. There are some reasons for dry skin on a newborn's face that could indicate a more serious problem. Not everything that looks like dry skin is actually dry skin.\nAnswer: All newborns experience peeling skin during the first two weeks of life. Peeling occurs when the outer layer of skin that was once surrounded by amniotic fluid and covered in vernix inside the uterus then peels off for a new layer of healthy skin to take over. The location and degree of newborn peeling on the body can vary, but it is not necessarily a sign of dry skin. Cradle cap is another common skin condition that affects a newborn baby's face and scalp, among other areas. It can look like slightly red scaly or yellow crusty or flaky patches. A healthcare professional can diagnose cradle cap and discuss treatment options if needed. Cradle cap usually clears up on its own in weeks or months. If you see peeling skin on your baby, don't peel or remove the skin; let it fall off on its own. If the skin dryness doesn't go away after two weeks, it may be a dry skin condition that should be addressed with your baby's pediatrician. Call your pediatrician immediately if the affected areas look red, bloody, or irritated or if peeling lasts longer than three weeks."}
{"question": "Can I put warm thawed breast milk back into refrigerator?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breast milk that has been thawed can become dangerous due to bacterial growth. There is a specific amount of time after thawing that breast milk can be safely used. There may be negative effects of allowing thawed breast milk to sit too long. Refrigeration is sufficient to keep breast milk safe to use.\nAnswer: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proper storage and preparation of breast milk guidelines, once breast milk is brought to room temperature or warmed, use it within two hours. It can be stored on the countertop at room temperature. If a baby does not finish a bottle, use leftover breastmilk within two hours after the baby is finished feeding. After two hours, leftover breast milk should be discarded."}
{"question": "Which is safer for a newborn - bedsharing or rock n play?", "answer": "Reasoning: Bedsharing and rock n play both have potential hazards. There are dangers associated with bedsharing. There are dangers associated with rock n play. There may not be a safe choice between bedsharing and rock n play.\nAnswer: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants sleep on their backs in their own sleep space with no other people. Use a crib, bassinet, or portable play yard with a firm, flat mattress and a fitted sheet and no bumpers, soft bedding, pillows, or stuffed toys. Bed-sharing is not recommended as it increases the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), suffocation, and other sudden unexpected infant deaths. Inclined baby sleepers such as the Fisher-Price Rock ‘n Play are also not safe for infant sleep. The Consumer Product Safety Commission notes that inclined sleepers have been tied to more than 100 infant deaths due to suffocation and are now banned under the Safe Sleep for Babies Act of 2022."}
{"question": "Can your pediatrician report you to CPS for co-sleeping?", "answer": "Reasoning: CPS stands for Child Protective Services. There are typical reasons that pediatricians report to CPS. The dangers of co-sleeping may be significant enough to warrant a call to CPS.\nAnswer: Co-sleeping is a type of sleeping situation where a parent and child sleep in close social or physical contact of each other. Room-sharing and bed-sharing are types of co-sleeping. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends room-sharing with baby for at least the first six months but warns against bed-sharing under any circumstances. No evidence exists that pediatricians should report cases of co-sleeping in the form of bed-sharing to Child Protective Services (CPS). Pediatricians assess and identify children with suspicious injuries and report cases of suspected abuse to CPS for investigation. While dangerous and not recommended, co-sleeping in the form of bed-sharing is not considered abuse or neglect. The AAP and pediatricians acknowledge that many parents choose to bed-share for a variety of reasons, including ease of breastfeeding, cultural preferences, and personal beliefs. Pediatricians are encouraged to counsel families on factors that increase the risk of sudden unexpected infant death while bed-sharing so families lower their risk if bed-sharing occurs."}
{"question": "How soon after your waters breaking did labor start?", "answer": "Reasoning: Not all pregnant women's water breaks prior to labor. Labor can start without the water breaking. Labor may progress faster after the water breaks. There may be a time delay between the water breaking and the start of labor. There may be a need to go to the hospital if the water breaks.\nAnswer: During pregnancy, your baby is surrounded and cushioned by a fluid-filled membranous sac called the amniotic sac. When the membranes rupture, it is known as your water breaking. Your water can break before labor begins, after contractions have started, or right before delivery. Your healthcare provider might even break your water for you. For most people, contractions and active labor starts before their water breaks and contractions usually intensify once your water has broken. If your water breaks and you have no other labor symptoms, contractions will typically start within 24 hours of your water breaking. Sometimes, however, labor doesn't start soon after the water breaks. The longer it takes for labor to start after your water breaks, the greater the risk of you or your baby developing an infection. Your doctor might stimulate uterine contractions to get labor started."}
{"question": "When can I turn my 12 month old baby to a front facing car seat?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are pros and cons to using a front facing car seat. There are factors that determine if a child is ready for a front facing car seat, such as age, weight, and other factors. There may be potential hazards associated with switching to a front facing car seat too soon. Different jurisdictions may have different requirements for when you can switch to a front facing car seat. My baby's size may impact when it is safe to switch to a front facing car seat.\nAnswer: According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), you should keep your child rear-facing as long as possible. It is the best way to keep your child safe. Your child should remain in a rear-facing car seat until he or she reaches the top height or weight limit allowed by your car seat's manufacturer. Convertible and All-in-One car seats typically have higher height and weight limits for the rear-facing position, allowing you to keep your child rear-facing for a longer period of time. Once your child outgrows the rear-facing car seat, your child is ready to travel in a forward-facing car seat with a harness and tether."}
{"question": "How much liquid should a newly weaned 1 year old drink daily?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies should be encouraged to drink a certain amount of liquid after weaning. There may be certain liquids that are better to offer a baby after weaning. The amount of liquid a baby should drink after weaning may be based on their age or weight. It may not be okay for a baby to not drink any liquid after weaning, even if they get enough fluids from their food. There may be potential harm that could come to a baby if they don't drink enough liquids after weaning. Using \"good tasting\" drinks like juice may be an acceptable way to entice a baby to drink more.\nAnswer: A toddler between the ages of 12-24 months needs about two cups of water per day to get enough fluids. Water is the best option when your child is thirsty. The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends giving pasteurized whole cow's milk without added sugars. A toddler should be limited to no more than two cups (16 fluid ounces) of milk a day to avoid iron deficiency. Too much milk may also decrease a child's appetite for other nutritious food. If you offer 100% fruit juice, keep it to less than 4 fluid ounces per day in a cup, not a bottle."}
{"question": "What is the cutoff temperature for bringing a 5-month-old baby outside in cold weather?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies may not be able to tolerate the same temperatures as adults, even if they are appropriately dressed. There is a temperature below which it is not safe to take a baby outside, regardless of how the baby is dressed. There are ways to ensure that a baby does not get too cold in cold weather. There are early signs that indicate a baby is becoming too cold.\nAnswer: It is best to limit an infant's time spent outside when the temperature is below freezing and especially if it is windy. Skin can freeze and suffer frostbite during prolonged exposure to freezing temperatures below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Wind can make temperatures even colder; when the wind chill is -15 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, frostbite can occur in 30 minutes or less even while wearing protective clothing. If your baby is outside in below freezing temperatures for even a short time, he or she can get frostbite. Infants lose heat from their skin more quickly than do adults. Infants don't shiver and cannot verbally express when they are feeling cold. Be particularly cautious on cold, windy days because wind makes the skin lose heat faster. Check often for signs of frostbite such as whitening of the skin, which usually appears first on extremities and areas that are most exposed to wind and cold. Check baby's face, ears, fingers, and toes frequently, even if you think baby is wearing plenty of clothing. If your baby is developing signs of frostbite, bring baby indoors immediately to avoid developing hypothermia, which occurs when the body temperature drops too low and is more serious and widespread in the body than frostbite."}
{"question": "What are the chances of mothers not being able to breastfeed?", "answer": "Reasoning: A significant percentage of women who attempt breastfeeding are unable to breastfeed. There are treatments, maneuvers, and other options available to improve the success of breastfeeding. There are alternatives to breastfeeding that can be considered. Breastfeeding is considered better for the baby and the mother compared to the alternative. There may be a feeling of not doing right by the baby if unable to breastfeed.\nAnswer: No studies have accurately estimated the number of women worldwide who are physiologically unable to breastfeed. Several physiological and anatomical factors may affect a woman's ability to breastfeed, including insufficient glandular tissue, breast surgery, and inverted nipples. Women with these conditions may still be able to breastfeed, but they may not achieve complete milk supply. Some conditions exist when mothers should not breastfeed or feed expressed breast milk for safety reasons, such as if the mother has certain viruses like HIV or Ebola, she is undergoing cancer treatment, or if she is taking certain medications or using illicit drugs. A mother also cannot breastfeed if her baby is born with certain conditions that do not enable the baby physically nurse or digest breast milk. More commonly, educational and societal barriers may prevent a woman from breastfeeding. For example, women may lack knowledge about breastfeeding and the skills needed to hold and position a baby at the breast, achieve a latch, and other techniques. The perceived inconvenience of breastfeeding, commitment required, and difficulties in establishing breastfeeding are sometimes keep a mother from breastfeeding. Women who encounter problems early on, such as pain, mastitis, and failure to establish a latch, are less likely to breastfeed. Concern about insufficient milk supply is another frequently cited reason women do not breastfeed. Having a poor milk supply can result from infrequent feeding or poor techniques, but lack of confidence in breastfeeding and not understanding normal lactation can lead to the misperception of an insufficient milk supply when the quantity is actually enough to nurture the baby. In addition, employed mothers typically find that returning to work is a significant barrier to breastfeeding, including lack of maternity leave and unsupportive work policies."}
{"question": "Is bleeding after a chemical pregnancy considered a period or something else?", "answer": "Reasoning: Bleeding after a chemical pregnancy may not be the same as a period. There is a difference between a period and vaginal bleeding from other causes. There is a way to know when a normal period has occurred after a chemical pregnancy. Bleeding after a chemical pregnancy may lead to heavier, serious hemorrhage. Bleeding after a chemical pregnancy may make it harder to become pregnant again in the future.\nAnswer: A chemical pregnancy is a very early pregnancy loss, or miscarriage, which usually happens within the first five weeks after the embryo implants in the uterus. The embryo stops developing, and the embryo and surrounding uterine tissue is passed from your uterus around the same time that you normally have your period. Chemical pregnancies occur so early that many people may not even realize they have experienced one. A common sign is a period that comes about a week later than usual. Bleeding after a chemical pregnancy may feel like a normal period, it may last slightly longer than usual, or it may be heavier than usual with more intense menstrual cramping. It is not possible to know whether you have had a chemical pregnancy without taking an early pregnancy test. As with a normal period, you can ovulate two weeks after a chemical pregnancy and potentially get pregnant."}
{"question": "Should a 5 month old still be feeding in the night?", "answer": "Reasoning: Night weaning is a process that babies go through. There may be a best time for babies to night wean. There is an age at which active night weaning should start if it hasn't happened naturally. Harm may come to my baby if he/she is not night weaned. Something may be wrong with my baby if he/she hasn't naturally night weaned by 5 months of age.\nAnswer: It is natural and common for babies to wake up throughout the night. A baby may wake up once or twice or as often as six times, and these patterns can change throughout your baby's first year. Usually, babies younger than six months wake up every three to four hours because they're hungry. Also, breastfed babies tend to eat more frequently than formula-fed babies because breastmilk is digested more quickly. Most babies start sleeping through the night by six months, which means they can sleep for five or six hours at a stretch without feeding. Some babies start sleeping longer even sooner, around four months. Baby sleep patterns by age aren't exact, and every baby is different. It is important to talk to your pediatrician about what is normal and necessary for your baby, taking into account your baby's size and growth as well as how often they're feeding, peeing, and pooping."}
{"question": "Can you still get pregnant if you're breastfeeding and don't have your period?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a chance of getting pregnant while breastfeeding. Breastfeeding can inhibit having a period. Feeding the baby formula or other foods may affect the chances of getting pregnant while breastfeeding. Having a period may not be necessary for a pregnancy to occur while breastfeeding.\nAnswer: Breastfeeding is a natural birth control option under certain conditions. Research shows it can be an effective method during the months when a woman is frequently breastfeeding, and an infant is receiving only breast milk as food (no formula, baby foods, or other foods). The medical term for this is lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), meaning not having a period or regular menstrual cycle while breastfeeding. Ovulation must occur in order to conceive a pregnancy, and breastfeeding a baby regularly helps prevent ovulation. To successfully prevent pregnancy, all of these LAM guidelines must be followed: your baby is younger than six months old and only breastfeeding; you breastfeed at least every four hours during the day and every six hours overnight; and you currently are not having periods. Studies show that when used correctly, LAM can be about as effective as hormonal methods like the birth control pill. It is 98% effective in the first six months after the baby is born. Your medical health provider can help you decide if this is a good birth control method for you right now and explain additional options."}
{"question": "Will my 5-month-old baby get COVID if I have it while breastfeeding?", "answer": "Reasoning: The COVID19 virus can be excreted through breast milk. There is a risk of your baby contracting COVID while breastfeeding through other means such as coughing or sneezing. There are safer ways to feed your baby if you have COVID. I can wear a mask while breastfeeding to prevent spreading COVID to my baby through coughing or sneezing.\nAnswer: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), breast milk is not a source of transmission of SARS-CO-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The virus spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus, which can then be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth or contaminate surfaces they touch. When possible, breastfeeding mothers with suspected for confirmed COVID-19, regardless of vaccination status, should continue to breastfeed. To minimize their infant's exposure to the virus, they should follow information on isolation and take hygiene precautions. Breastfeeding mothers should wash their hands using soap and water or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol before touching their child or expressing breast milk by hand or with a breast pump. Wear a mask when in close contact with the infant, such as when feeding at the breast or feeding from a bottle, and when expressing breast milk. Clean and sanitize breast pumps and all infant feeding items. If a mother is too sick to breastfeed her infant, another healthy caregiver can bottle feed the infant her expressed breast milk. The mother should be encouraged to regularly express milk, such as with a breast pump, so the infant continues to receive breast milk and the mother maintains her milk supply. Research indicates that the breast milk of mothers with COVID-19 contains antibodies and other factors that may provide immunological protection to infants."}
{"question": "Is it possible to have an unmedicated birth with severe SPD, RLP, and hemorrhoids?", "answer": "Reasoning: The pain from SPD, RLP, and hemorrhoids may make it difficult to have an unmedicated birth. There may be non-medication treatments or positions that can increase the chances of an unmedicated birth with these conditions present. There may be other ways to make the pain from these conditions bearable during labor besides medication.\nAnswer: Symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD), round ligament pain (RLP), and hemorrhoids are common conditions in pregnancy that cause pelvic girdle pain. While these conditions are uncomfortable and can be quite painful, they do not pose a danger to you or the baby during pregnancy. Pelvic girdle pain can add additional pain to delivery but doesn't necessarily guarantee the delivery will be more difficult. If you are planning to birth without medication, other pain relief techniques are available. Common options are massage, water therapy, and breathing exercises. Music and calming smells can help you relax. Moving around and changing positions during labor are recommended to reduce pelvic girdle pain, as are using a birthing stool or ball. It will also help to have a support person with you during labor. Sometimes labor does not go as planned, and your obstetrician and birth support team may need to use other tools to help you safely deliver, such as pain medication or a cesarean section. The ultimate goal is a healthy baby and a healthy mom. Usually pelvic girdle conditions such as SPD, RLP, and hemorrhoids go away within days or a few months after delivering your baby."}
{"question": "Can I change my OB doctor at 37 weeks?", "answer": "Reasoning: I can change from one OB to another at any point in my pregnancy, including at 37 weeks. There may be reasons why it's not a good idea to change my OB at 37 weeks. It may be difficult to find another OB who will accept me as a patient at 37 weeks. There may be scenarios that make it necessary to change to a different OB at 37 weeks. It may be dangerous to change to a different OB at or after 37 weeks.\nAnswer: It is possible to switch to a new obstetrician late in pregnancy, but sometimes you may have a harder time switching practices as some doctors may not want to take someone on mid-pregnancy. Although you have a medical history of your pregnancy with your previous obstetrician, the physician's office should be able to transfer your medical records to your new healthcare provider's office. Sometimes a switch needs to happen for practical reasons, such as when you move, your doctor moves or retires, or your insurance changes. You may simply realize that you are not happy with your prenatal care or birth plan and want to find someone who can provide you with the care that you need. Regular prenatal care is extremely important in optimizing the health of both mother and baby. From week 36 to the end of pregnancy, you should go for one checkup every week, and more often if you have complications. It is important not to miss any prenatal care checkups, even if you're feeling fine."}
{"question": "Is there a good non-dairy baby milk I can supplement for my newborn?", "answer": "Reasoning: Non-dairy milks may not have the right amount of calories and nutrients for a newborn. There may be other things in non-dairy milks that make them unsafe for newborns. Not all non-dairy milks are equally good or bad for every baby. There is a criteria for what makes a milk good or bad for a baby. Non-dairy milks may not be fortified with everything newborns need.\nAnswer: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), babies should only drink human breastmilk or formula for at least the first year of life because breast milk and dairy milk-based formulas offer complete nutrition. Milk alternatives should not be given before 12 months. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) indicates that soy-based protein formulas may be used in place of a cow milk-based formula for full-term infants with rare conditions such as galactosemia and hereditary lactase deficiency and in situation in which a vegetarian diet is preferred. Soy protein-based formulas are not recommended for preterm infants. Infants with cow's milk allergies often have soy allergies as well. For infants with cow milk protein allergy or intolerance, extensively hydrolyzed protein formula should be considered. In this formula, a cow's milk protein called casein is broken down into smaller pieces for easier digestion. Most babies with cow's milk allergy will tolerate these formulas. Lactose-free dairy formulas containing no lactose are also available for infants who have difficulty digesting lactose. Amino acid-based formulas also offer complete nutrition for infants who can't tolerate extensively hydrolyzed formulas."}
{"question": "Can I add milk from another pump session to the same bottle as from the first pumping session in the same day?", "answer": "Reasoning: Milk from a subsequent pump session may contaminate the milk from the first pumping session of the day. It may be necessary to take precautions to ensure the safety of adding milk to a previous pump session's bottle. It may not be safe to add warm milk from a subsequent pump session to refrigerated cold milk from earlier in the day.\nAnswer: Mixing freshly expressed breast milk with already cooled (refrigerated) or frozen breast milk is not advised because it can rewarm the older stored milk. It is best to cool freshly expressed milk before combining it with the older, previously cooled or frozen milk. When combining milk, the duration of storage should be based on when the older milk was first stored."}
{"question": "Can I refuse to have a vaginal birth?", "answer": "Reasoning: A vaginal birth may be painful and could potentially lead to problems later on. There may be risks associated with a scheduled C-section that is not medically necessary. An OB may not be forced to perform a non-medically necessary C-section. There may be future risks associated with a non-medically necessary C-section.\nAnswer: According to the American Academy of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), in the absence of maternal or fetal indications for cesarean delivery, vaginal deliveries are usually recommended as safe and appropriate. It is possible, however, to request a cesarean delivery (C-section). Pregnant patients should speak with their obstetricians to discuss the reasons behind the request for cesarean delivery as well as the risks and benefits. Obstetricians should consider a patient's specific risk factors, age, body mass index, accuracy of estimated gestational age, future reproductive plans, personal values, and cultural context before deciding if a C-section is an option. Once a patient delivers by C-section, subsequent pregnancies are more likely to be delivered by C-section, which increases risks for placental abnormalities. If a patient's main motivation to elect a cesarean delivery is a fear of pain in childbirth, obstetricians should discuss and offer patient analgesia options for labor as well as emotional support in labor."}
{"question": "How long should a woman wait to get pregnant again after giving birth?", "answer": "Reasoning: Women may not resume ovulating immediately after giving birth. There may be risks to both the baby and the mother from getting pregnant too soon after giving birth. There is an ideal timeframe to attempt pregnancy after giving birth.\nAnswer: Experts recommend waiting 18 months or more between pregnancies to allow the uterus time to heal and allows your body time to fully recover from your last pregnancy. It is also safer for the birthing parent and infant. Getting pregnant again before 18 months increases the risk for certain health problems for your baby, including premature birth, low birthweight, and being small for gestational age. Babies born with these health conditions are at higher risk of having long-term health problems or even death."}
{"question": "How long should a newborn sleep in the same room before transferring to the nursery?", "answer": "Reasoning: Room sharing is a practice where the baby sleeps in the same room as the parents. There are benefits to room sharing. There are risks associated with room sharing for too long. There is an ideal time to transition from room sharing to the nursery.\nAnswer: According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the best place for a baby to sleep for the first year of life is in the parents' bedroom on his or her own sleep surface designed for an infant, such as in a crib, bassinet, play yard, or bedside sleeper. Studies have shown that when babies sleep close by to their parents, it can help reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and other sudden unexpected infant deaths. Also, having the baby sleep nearby help support breastfeeding during the night. Some parents may be tempted to move an infant to another room in order to get more sleep, but the AAP recommends waiting until the baby is at least six months old."}
{"question": "Is there anything that can make you measure big that's worth being concerned about?", "answer": "Reasoning: Fundal height measurement is meant to assess something specific. Measuring too small or too big can reveal certain issues. These issues can potentially be serious.\nAnswer: Fundal height measurement is the distance in centimeters from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus. The measurement is typically done to determine if a baby is growing normally for its gestational age. The expectation is that after week 24 of pregnancy, the fundal height for a normally growing baby will match the number of weeks of pregnancy, plus or minus two centimeters. A fundal height that measures larger than expected or increases more quickly than expected could indicate a multiple pregnancy, a significantly larger than average baby, or too much amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios). Your health care provider might recommend an ultrasound to determine what is causing the unusual measurements. If you are concerned about your fundal height measurements, talk to your health care provider."}
{"question": "When is it safe to get the Covid vaccine postpartum?", "answer": "Reasoning: Getting a COVID vaccine may not be safe during pregnancy. Getting a COVID vaccine may not be safe immediately after delivery or during breastfeeding. The COVID vaccine may have substances that can pass through the placenta or breast milk to the baby. There may be a reason to wait until after pregnancy or breastfeeding to get the COVID vaccine. There may be benefits to both the mother and baby in getting the COVID vaccine during pregnancy or breastfeeding. There may be common side effects of the COVID vaccine. These side effects (or others) may be more common in pregnant or breastfeeding women.\nAnswer: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), if you were recently pregnant, you should get vaccinated for COVID-19. People who are pregnant or recently gave birth are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 compared to people who are not pregnant. Healthcare professionals may recommend some mothers receive the vaccines right after giving birth to protect them from getting sick from COVID-19, although it can take about two weeks after getting vaccinated before the body develops antibodies. In addition, studies suggest that COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people who are breastfeeding and are effective at preventing COVID-19 infection in people who are breastfeeding. Recent reports have shown that breastfeeding people who have received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have antibodies in their breast milk, which could help protect their babies from COVID-19 infection."}
{"question": "How painful is getting an epidural during labor?", "answer": "Reasoning: Getting an epidural during labor is painful. There is a procedure called an epidural that is administered during labor. An anesthesiologist plays a role in lessening the pain of an epidural.\nAnswer: Epidural anesthesia is the most popular and most effective method of pain relief during labor. During placement of an epidural, first a small area of your back will be injected with a local anesthetic to numb the area so you do not feel the epidural needle and catheter insertion. Some people describe an epidural placement as creating a bit of discomfort in the area where the back was numbed and a feeling of pressure as the catheter was placed. Usually, the procedure is not very painful. Next, a needle is then inserted into the numbed area surrounding the spinal cord in the lower back, and a catheter is threaded through the needle into the epidural space. The needle is removed, leaving the catheter in place to provide medication either through periodic injections or by continuous infusion. You will start to notice the numbing effect about 10 to 20 minutes after the first dose of medication, though the nerves in your uterus will begin to numb within minutes. Your labor pain will decrease significantly as continuous doses of medication will be delivered through the catheter for the rest of your labor."}
{"question": "When should my 4-month-old baby be able to fall asleep on their own?", "answer": "Reasoning: A 4-month old baby may have trouble falling asleep on its own right after birth. There is an age at which a baby should be expected to fall asleep on its own. There are things that can be done to help a 4-month old baby fall asleep on its own. A 4-month old baby should be able to fall asleep on its own.\nAnswer: Infants younger than three months rely on you to soothe them back to sleep because they cannot yet regulate their emotions. After your baby is about three months old, you can begin to teach him or her to self-soothe. Babies who self-soothe can calm down with little or no help from you. This process can take some time, but it helps both baby and mother in the long run. Even babies who are old enough to sleep through the night without feeding continue to awaken during the night briefly four to six times. To help baby learn how to put himself or herself back to sleep, you can try a few different methods to see what works for your baby. Put your baby in the crib when he or she is drowsy but still awake to get used to falling asleep without rocking or feeding. You could try sleep training and experiment with several different strategies. Give your baby plenty of attention while they're awake to help them feel calm and safe, which can translate to better sleep. In between naps during the day, make sure your baby has time for physical play. Keep naps part of baby's daytime routine to prevent baby from getting overtired, which can lead to difficulty getting to sleep. Keep in mind, it is still important to check on your baby if he or she wakes up in the night or during a nap and starts crying to make sure all basic needs are met; self-soothing doesn't work for babies who are hungry, sick, or have a dirty diaper."}
{"question": "What is considered normal weight gain during pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: The average woman gains weight during pregnancy. There is variability in weight gain during pregnancy. There may be concern if a woman gains too much or too little weight during pregnancy. Many women gain too much weight during pregnancy. Gained weight is difficult to take off postpartum.\nAnswer: How much weight you should gain during pregnancy is based on your body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy. BMI is a measure of body fat calculated from weight and height. Weight gain recommendations for women pregnant with one baby are as follows: underweight women (BMI less than 18.5) should gain 28-40 pounds; normal weight women (BMI 18.5-24.9) should gain 24-35 pounds; overweight women (BMI 25.0-29.9) should gain 15-25 pounds; and obese women (BMI greater than or equal to 30.0) should gain 11-20 pounds. The weight gain recommendations are greater for women pregnant with multiples. Gaining less than the recommended amount of weight in pregnancy is associated with delivering a baby who is too small and may have difficulty breastfeeding, at an increased risk for illness, and may experience developmental delays. Gaining more than the recommended amount of weight in pregnancy is associated with having a baby who is born too large, which can lead to delivery complications and obesity during childhood."}
{"question": "Can I tell my doctor about my depression and suicidal thoughts without being deemed an unfit mother?", "answer": "Reasoning: Depression and suicidal thoughts can potentially harm a baby. It is important to address depression and suicidal thoughts. Having suicidal thoughts does not necessarily mean a woman will attempt suicide. Depression and suicidal thoughts may not be very common. There is a concern about being deemed an unfit mother if depression and suicidal thoughts are disclosed to a doctor.\nAnswer: If you have symptoms of postpartum depression, you may be reluctant or embarrassed to admit it, but getting help is one of the most important things you can do for yourself and your family. Depression is a common problem after pregnancy. One in eight new mothers report experiencing postpartum depression in the year after childbirth. Health care providers often screen for symptoms of postpartum depression at the first postpartum checkup. Treating your depression can help you be healthier and feel better, help you take better care of your baby, and improve the long-term health of you and your child. Call your obstetrician, pediatrician, or health care provider as soon as possible to schedule an appointment. If you have thoughts about hurting yourself, seek help immediately by calling 911 or a suicide and crisis hotline. Ask your partner or a loved one to call for you if necessary, and seek help from loved ones in taking care of your baby. Untreated postpartum depression can affect your ability to parent. You may not have enough energy to do the things necessary to take care of yourself and your baby, have trouble focusing on the baby's needs or your own needs, and have a higher risk of attempting suicide. Researchers believe that postpartum depression in a mother can also affect the healthy development of her child. Getting treatment is important for you and for the health of your baby. Working with a health care professional is a good way to create a plan that will work for you, which may include therapy, support groups, and medication."}
{"question": "Can a baby receive the MMR vaccine before one year?", "answer": "Reasoning: The MMR vaccine is not recommended for babies before one year. There is a reason why the MMR vaccine is not recommended before one year. There may be potential harms associated with administering the MMR vaccine before one year.\nAnswer: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends children get two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age."}
{"question": "Should I send my 5-month-old baby to daycare during the Coronavirus outbreak?", "answer": "Reasoning: The baby could potentially get sick if they go to daycare during the Coronavirus outbreak. There is a risk of the baby bringing the coronavirus back home to other family members if they go to daycare. Daycares may not be able to prevent COVID outbreaks even if they take precautions. There is a way to know if anyone in my family has or has had COVID recently. There is a way to know if the baby is showing symptoms of COVID. There is a way to know if the baby's daycare is taking appropriate precautions to decrease the risks.\nAnswer: When it comes to the best care options for your baby during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is not one right answer for every family. It depends on where you live, the health of your child and other family members in your household, and the steps your daycare facility takes to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. You should talk to your pediatrician about childcare options to help you decide what is best for your situation based on your child's overall health, your child's medical history, your family circumstances, if immunizations are up to date, and if your child's growth and development are on track. Make sure you are comfortable with how the daycare center plans to clean and disinfect, screen children and staff for symptoms, and handle illness with testing and isolation. Research suggest that childcare centers do not fuel the spread of COVID-19 in communities when they take proper safety steps. Taking all these factors into consideration will help you make the right decision and keep your family as safe as possible."}
{"question": "Is breast milk always the best option for feeding a baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breast milk has benefits for a baby. There may be dangers associated with feeding a baby breast milk. There are some barriers to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding may be hard or my milk may not come in, so I may need to feed my baby something else. Breast milk may not always be the best option for feeding a baby.\nAnswer: U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that infants be exclusively breastfed for about the first six months, and then continuing breastfeeding while introducing appropriate complementary foods until your child is 12 months or older. The American Academy of Pediatrics (APA) also recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months and up to two years of age or longer. Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for most babies. It has hormones and the right amount of protein, sugar, fat, calories, and most vitamins to help baby grow and develop. Breast milk also has antibodies to help protect baby from many illnesses. As baby grows, a mother's breast milk will change to meet her baby's nutritional needs. Breastfeeding can also help protect mother and baby against some short- and long-term illnesses and diseases. For some babies, breast milk may not be the best option for feeding baby. Babies should not consume breast milk if they have certain health conditions such as galactosemia, allergies to milk protein, or lactose intolerance. Babies may have additional issues such as reflux, digestion problems, or low birth-weight, making breastfeeding difficult or insufficient. Mothers may not be able to make enough breast milk to support their baby's growth, and in some rare cases, a mother's breast milk may not be safe for the baby. In these circumstances, a baby's pediatrician will likely recommend formula feeding. Talk to your pediatrician for guidance in making sure your baby is meeting his or her nutritional needs."}
{"question": "Am I overfeeding my 2 month old by giving him 6 ounces per feeding?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a normal amount to feed a 2 month old. There may be harm that can come to a baby if they are overfed. It may not be advisable to let the baby eat whatever amount they want if they still seem to be hungry.\nAnswer: At about two months of age, babies usually take four to five ounces per feeding every three to four hours. It is important to remember that all babies are different. Some babies like to snack more often, and others drink more at one time and go longer between feedings. Babies are usually pretty good at eating the right amount that their body requires, but they can sometimes take in more than they need. Infants who are bottle feeding may be more likely to overfeed because drinking from a bottle takes less effort than breastfeeding. Overfed babies can have stomach pains and gas or spit up or vomit. Talk to your pediatrician if you are concerned your baby wants to eat all the time or shows signs of being overfed."}
{"question": "Can I breastfeed past a year but stop pumping and only nurse 3 times a day?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breastfeeding as long as possible is preferred. There is flexibility in how much to breastfeed and whether to supplement with other types of food. Most babies transition from breast milk to other types of foods at some point. There may be some harm to breastfeeding past one year. My baby won't be as healthy or could have problems if I stop feeding breast milk at one year. I'm not confident I can maintain breast pumping past one year.\nAnswer: Your milk supply depends on how often you nurse or pump your breasts. The less you breastfeed or pump, the less milk your body makes. If you stop pumping and breastfeed exclusively, your body will adjust its milk supply to maintain the volume your child drinks. If your one-year-old toddler still consumes a large amount of breastmilk each time he or she nurses, you will likely maintain a large milk supply. Conversly, if your toddler is just be “grazing” and drinks smaller quantities due to getting most of his or her nutrition from solid foods, then your milk supply will likely decrease. Breastfed babies over one year may also consume whole dairy milk. By age one, your baby should be eating a variety of other foods as well as drinking 2-3 cups (480-720 milliliters) of milk a day. If you feel you are not producing enough breastmilk to satisfy your growing toddler's nutrition requirements, then introducing whole dairy milk is an option."}
{"question": "Is it safe to attend a funeral 2 weeks after a C-section?", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be persistent issues like significant pain or infection from the C-section. There may have been complications like blood clots during or after the C-section. There is a potential risk of incisions breaking open if traveling to and attending the funeral. There is a potential risk of developing problems from sitting too long during travel or at the funeral. There is a potential risk of experiencing too much pain and not being able to control it with medication, leading to drowsiness. There may be a need to fly or take a long car ride to get to the funeral.\nAnswer: Getting up and walking around once you are home from the hospital after delivering a baby via cesarean section (C-section) will help you heal faster and can help prevent blood clots. You should be able to do most of your regular activities in four to eight weeks. Before then, only take short walks and do light physical activity. Slowly increase your amount of physical activity, and expect to tire easily. No specific restrictions exist for activities, but it is important to listen to your body and rest often. Also, don't drive a car for at least two weeks if you are taking narcotic pain medicine or feel weak or unsafe driving. Contact your provider if you have any sign of infection in your incision site, your incision breaks open, you develop a fever, have increased pain in your belly, or develop symptoms of postpartum depression."}
{"question": "Is it okay to leave my 4 month old baby alone in a safe spot while I quickly go to the bathroom or kitchen?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a safe spot where I can leave my baby alone for a short period of time. I can still be within earshot of my baby while leaving him/her alone.\nAnswer: Safety is paramount when you must briefly leave your infant unattended. Often, injuries happen because parents are not aware of what their children can do, and children are fast learners. At about four months old, babies become more aware of their surroundings and want to explore. Their vision becomes clearer. They can start to roll over, which can result in a fall if baby is left alone on changing tables, beds, sofas, or chairs. When you cannot hold your baby, a safe place for a baby is a crib or playpen. Make sure to take precautions to baby-proof your home before leaving your baby briefly unattended on the floor. Use baby gates on the top and bottom of stairways, and close doors to keep baby out of rooms where he or she might get hurt. At four months, babies can begin to grasp toys, and anything within reach is likely to end up their mouths. They might start pulling objects closer with a raking motion of their hands. Never leave small objects within your baby's reach, even for a moment as they are potential choking hazards. Plastic wrappers and bags pose suffocation hazards and should be kept away from your baby. Put safety locks on all cabinets that contain cleaning products or medicine. Place safety covers on electric outlets. Lock all windows and install window guards. Keep houseplants out of reach. Do not leave large containers like buckets or large bowls out that have water in them due to the risk of drowning."}
{"question": "Is it risky to climb stairs in the first trimester of pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: Pregnant women may be more likely to fall down stairs during the first trimester than the average person. There may be balance issues that occur during the first trimester. There may be episodes of dizziness, fainting, low blood pressure, or other concerns for falling during the first trimester. There are precautions that can be taken to make climbing stairs as safe as possible. If I fall during the first trimester, I may risk losing the pregnancy.\nAnswer: No evidence exists that climbing stairs during pregnancy is risky. One risk from climbing stairs is tripping and falling. Minor falls during early pregnancy are typically not of concern. If you have a minor fall during your first trimester, call your health care provider, describe the fall, and discuss any symptoms you might have. Precautions to stay safe when climbing up and down stairs include taking your time and not running, holding onto the railings for balance, avoiding distractions, not carrying large items, making sure there is enough light to see where you are stepping, and being aware of what you're wearing (slippery shoes or long garments). For most pregnant people, physical activity is safe and recommended for you and baby. If you're healthy and were physically active before you got pregnant, it's usually safe to continue your activities during pregnancy. Experts recommend finding ways to be active in your everyday life. Talk to your health care provider about safe activities during pregnancy."}
{"question": "How can I increase my let down speed during breastfeeding?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a flow of breast milk called let down speed. There may be ways to increase or maintain let down speed during breastfeeding. There is a concern about the flow of breast milk being too low.\nAnswer: Let-down occurs when breast milk releases from tiny sacs in the breast and “lets down” into the nipple, allowing a baby to breastfeed. Let-down is a reflex regulated by a chain reaction that starts with the release of the hormone oxytocin. The pituitary gland at the base of your brain releases oxytocin as a reaction to different stimuli, such as a baby sucking your nipple, when you see, hear, or think about your baby, when you touch your breasts, or when you're expressing milk. If your let-down doesn't come quickly and easily, one way to improve let-down includes relaxation. Stress can prevent your oxytocin release, so finding ways to manage stress and relax can help. Finding a comfortable spot to nurse is helpful, as well as taking deep breaths and listening to relaxing music. Use a preferred breastfeeding position that feels comfortable for you and your baby. Getting into the same position each time can cue your brain to trigger the let-down reflex. Focusing on your baby and using skin-to-skin contact can help. Before breastfeeding, pump or hand express for about a minute before breastfeeding, gently massage your breasts, or use a moist heating pad or warm wash cloth on your breasts. Pain can inhibit let-down, so if you have pain while breastfeeding, contact a healthcare provider or lactation consultant to address the cause."}
{"question": "Can you legally be forced to transfer during labor?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are common reasons for having to transfer during labor. There may be serious outcomes if transfer is delayed or not initiated. Pregnant patients may be treated differently than others when it comes to bodily autonomy. Pregnant patients may be expected to sign informed consent about the risks of refusing transfer. There is a concern that doctors may not have the best interest of the patient in mind during labor and delivery. There is a concern that the patient can be forced into things they don't want during labor.\nAnswer: No evidence exists that a pregnant person can be legally forced to transfer to a hospital or birth center during labor at home. Data from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) demonstrates that hospitals and accredited birth centers are the safest settings for birth, but each pregnant person has the right to make a medically informed decision about delivery. It is imperative that pregnant people planning a home birth are informed about the factors that are critical to reducing perinatal mortality rates and ensuring the safety of both mother and baby. Planned home births are not recommended for safety reasons in certain circumstances, such as fetal malpresentation, pregnancy with multiples, or prior cesarean delivery. Unplanned home birth is especially unsafe, and patients in need of critical support following an unplanned home birth often require emergency transfer to a hospital. When planning a home birth in the prenatal period, it is recommended that the midwife provide the patient with information about hospital care and procedures that may be necessary in the event of an emergency. The midwife should develop and document a plan with the patient for hospital transfer should the need arise."}
{"question": "How much breast milk should I be able to express in a sitting at 2 weeks postpartum?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a normal rate of breast milk expression at 2 weeks postpartum. The rate of breast milk expression may change during the postpartum period. There may be something that can be done to influence the breast milk expression rate. I may not be able to express enough milk early in the postpartum period for my baby. There may be something that can be done to improve breast milk expression if I'm unable to express enough naturally. My baby may suffer if I cannot express enough milk at 2 weeks postpartum.\nAnswer: By the end of the first 10-12 days postpartum, a mother will be producing around 16-32 ounces (500-1,000 milliliters) of breastmilk per day. The amount produced per pumping session varies and depends on how frequently the mother pumps and whether the mother is exclusively pumping or pumping and breastfeeding. Don't be discouraged if it takes a few pumping sessions to express a full bottle. Many women worry they don't have enough milk for their babies, but it is rare to have an actual problem with making milk. To increase milk supply, pump more frequently. Also try massaging your breasts before, during, and after pumping. Make sure the breast shield on the pump is the right size and placed correctly over your breast. If breastfeeding, pump immediately after breastfeeding to ensure full emptying of the breasts. Keep your baby close by while pumping or hold something that reminds you of your baby to trigger milk let-down. Also, find a comfortable spot to pump and relax. Your let-down reflex can be affected by stress. Taking some medications or the herb called fenugreek may also help increase milk supply. If you have questions or concerns about how much milk you are expressing talk to a lactation consultant or your health care provider."}
{"question": "Is PPD a valid reason for not breastfeeding?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breastfeeding may have an impact on PPD. There may be reasons that are considered valid for not breastfeeding. There may be concerns about the safety of breastfeeding if a woman has PPD.\nAnswer: If a mother is experiencing postpartum depression (PPD), it is important to consider if breastfeeding brings her joy and peace or makes her depression symptoms worse. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about six months and up to a year if mutually desired by mother and baby. If breastfeeding is helping a mother bond with her baby and not contributing to her PPD symptoms, then PPD treatment can and should be built around protecting the breastfeeding relationship. If breastfeeding is contributing to a mom's PPD symptoms, she should not feel guilty if she chooses to seek alternative forms of feeding."}
{"question": "Is it possible to wean my 10 month old baby in the next 10 days before a visitation?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a way to wean a baby rapidly within 10 days. There may be alternatives or arrangements that can be made instead of weaning the baby. There may be concerns about the safety of rapid weaning. There may be concerns about the ability to pump and freeze enough breast milk in the next 10 days. There may be a desire to continue breastfeeding during a visitation.\nAnswer: If you need or want to actively wean your baby before it happens naturally, it is best for you and your child to go slowly. Weaning too suddenly can be physically painful for you and emotionally hard on you and your baby. The time it takes to wean depends on several factors, including your baby's age, the number of times each day you typically breastfeed, and whether your child is ready to wean. Especially during the first year, when breastfeeding is your baby's main source of nutrition, weaning works best if you eliminate just one nursing session at a time over several days. For example, if you drop a feeding every three days, and you usually nurse about eight times a day, it could take four weeks to fully wean your baby. Weaning your child too quickly may cause your breasts to become painfully engorged. If your baby is younger than one year old, you will need to substitute your breast milk with formula. Consider delaying weaning if your baby is teething or sick because your baby will need extra comfort during these times. Antibodies in breastmilk can also help your baby fight off illness. Also, if your baby is resisting all of your attempts to wean, it may just not be the right time. If you can, wait and try again in another month or two."}
{"question": "When should I start sleep training my almost two month old baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a concept called sleep training. There is a best time to start sleep training. There may be potential problems with sleep if sleep training is started too late. There may be potential problems with sleep if sleep training is started too early.\nAnswer: Infants younger than three months rely on a caregiver to rock, hold, or nurse them to soothe back to sleep because they can't yet regulate their emotions. After a baby is about three months old, he or she can be taught to self-soothe. Babies who self-soothe can calm down with little or no help from you. The process may involve sleep training and can take some time, but it helps your baby and you in the long run. It's still important to check on your baby if he or she wakes up a start crying to make sure all basic needs are met. Self-soothing won't work for babies who are hungry, sick, or have a dirty diaper. Sleep training may require several different methods. One method that works for one baby may not work for another. It's ok to experiment or combine methods as needed to help your baby."}
{"question": "Can you diet while nursing?", "answer": "Reasoning: Calorie requirements may change while nursing. There may be negative side effects from not consuming enough calories while nursing. Breastfeeding may aid in weight loss.\nAnswer: Pregnancy and lactation are special stages of life for women, and nutrition plays a vital role to support the health of the mother and baby. Increased calorie and nutrient intakes are necessary to support the growth and development of the baby and maintain the mother's health. Women should meet their increased calorie and nutrient needs with nutrient-dense foods as part of a healthy diet pattern. Breastfeeding mothers generally need an additional 330 to 400 kilocalories to meet their nutritional needs while breastfeeding, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The number of additional calories needed is also affected by age, body mass index (BMI), activity level, and the extent of breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding versus breastfeeding and formula feeding). Postpartum weight retention results in about one in seven women moving from a healthy weight classification before pregnancy to an overweight classification postpartum. Weight management is complex, so women should seek advice from a healthcare provider on the best way to achieve their weight management goals while breastfeeding."}
{"question": "Is it safe to lay on my stomach at 28 weeks of pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are certain positions for sleeping that are okay in the second and third trimester. Sleeping on the stomach while pregnant may have potential risks. There is a way to sleep safely if I can't lay on my back in the third trimester.\nAnswer: While it may not be comfortable, it is fine to lay on your stomach at any point in pregnancy. An alternate is lying on your side, which helps blood flow to the fetus.   Lying on your back is not recommended because of pressure in a major vein that can cause disruptions in blood flow."}
{"question": "Is it okay to give my baby a bottle full of foremilk with no hindmilk?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a difference between foremilk and hindmilk when feeding a baby. There are benefits to giving a baby both foremilk and hindmilk. There may be potential negative consequences if a baby only receives foremilk and no hindmilk. It is important to try to feed the baby any milk, but there may be benefits to providing both foremilk and hindmilk.\nAnswer: The concept of foremilk and hindmilk has been widely debunked, with experts staying that there is no moment during a pumping or nursing session where the milk suddenly changes and becomes more fatty.  Due to it being a gradual change throughout the pumping or nursing session, as long as the milk removed is enough to make a bottle for baby, then it is fine to give baby whatever milk you have expressed.  If you are concerned with your infant receiving higher fat milk, make sure to keep them on the breast until it is drained, or express milk until the breast is drained for the other feedings."}
{"question": "Is it important to use the slow flow nipple in the feeding bottle at all times or should I switch to the faster flow nipple for my 4 month old?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies can handle faster milk flows as they grow. The flow speed of bottle nipples is important for feeding babies. Using the same bottle nipple throughout feeding times may not be appropriate for all ages. There is a point at which it is necessary to increase the speed of the nipple used for feeding.\nAnswer: If you are switching between breast and bottle, it's important to keep the infant on a slow nipple for as long as they are willing to take it.  Using a slow nipple ensures that the baby is using the same muscles to bottle feed that they are using to breastfeed and can help eliminate flow preference (mistakenly thought of as nipple confusion).  If you are strictly bottle feeding, positioning is more important than flow.  As long as baby is supported, sitting upright, and the bottle is being paced so baby doesn't choke, you are fine to use a slightly faster nipple."}
{"question": "When should I give my baby fever reducing meds after shots?", "answer": "Reasoning: Giving Tylenol too soon after a vaccine may make the vaccine less effective. There is a certain amount of time that needs to pass before giving fever reducing meds after a shot. It is safe to give Tylenol to a baby after they receive their shots. Receiving shots can cause a fever in a baby.\nAnswer: Fever is a normal and usually harmless reaction to vaccines as baby's immune system is working hard to make antibodies.   Most fevers begin within 12 hours and last 1-2 days. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that low grade fevers of 100-102° F (37.8 to 39° C), do not need fever medicines as they might interfere with baby's immune making response.  For fevers above 102° F (39° C), they advise acetaminophen for discomfort.  Alternate rememdies include staying hydrated (breastmilk or formula for children less than 1 year) and dressing in normal clothing, using a blanket to help with chills."}
{"question": "What does a dilation check feel like during pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: A dilation check during pregnancy may cause discomfort or pain. A dilation check during pregnancy may cause bleeding or spotting. A dilation check involves the provider using their hand to measure how open the cervix is. The provider's hand will touch the cervix during a dilation check, which can cause pain or spotting. There may be a choice to decline a dilation check if it is painful. A dilation check is important in pregnancy.\nAnswer: An internal check is used to check for dilation or abnormalities during pregnancy.  Your midwife or OB should ask your permission before starting.  Once consent is given, usually two gloved and lubricated fingers are inserted into the vagina to feel the cervix.  This should not be uncomfortable at any point.  If it is, tell your OB or midwife right away so that they can stop.  If you have anxiety over internal exams, let your practitioner know beforehand so that you can come up with ways to help you feel more comfortable."}
{"question": "How long is too long to let my 6-week old baby go between feeds at night?", "answer": "Reasoning: I can't let my baby sleep through the night. I have to feed them. There is a certain interval that I need to be waking my baby up to feed, even if they are sleeping. If they don't wake up crying they can continue to sleep. They will wake me if they are hungry. It is safe to let my baby tell me they are hungry by crying and set their own schedule. At six weeks old, a baby may have a certain feeding schedule. At six weeks old, it may still be necessary to rely on hunger cues and the baby waking up on their own to know when to feed. It may not\nAnswer: Sleeping through the night is considered 5-6 consecutive hours of sleep for newborns and infants.  As long as your baby is gaining appropriately (0.5-1 oz per day), stooling daily, having at least 5 heavy wet diapers and is feeding at least 7 times a day, then they are fine to sleep as long as they would like.  If you are breastfeeding, it is important to not go longer than 6 hours, as you will be very uncomfortable and run the risk of infection and decreased supply.  If your baby wants to sleep longer than that, chat with an IBCLC on how to manage discomfort.  If you are formula feeding, as long as you get the proper amount of ounces into baby during the day time, the AAP states that babies are fine to go without feeding overnight.  Frequent wake ups are developmentally normal though and you should expect your infant to wake multiple times a night."}
{"question": "How can I avoid purple pushing during hospital birth?", "answer": "Reasoning: Purple pushing is a method of pushing during delivery. There are alternative techniques or exercises to purple pushing. Nurses or providers may try to coerce me into doing purple pushing. I can communicate to my providers that I do not want to do purple pushing during delivery. There are other types of pushing that can be done during delivery that are not purple pushing. Purple pushing can have risks and benefits for both the baby and the pelvic floor. Purple pushing may result in a faster delivery. Purple pushing can be tiring and may lead to hemorrhoids. Purple pushing can cause the face to turn purple from straining and lack of oxygen.\nAnswer: The best way to avoid purple pushing if you have an epidural is to make sure that it is turned down so that you can feel pressure.  This will help you to know when to push.  Pushing too early is one of the main causes of purple pushing.  Once you reach 10 cm, if all is well, it is helpful to wait until you feel the urge to push. The pushing phase is the most stressful for the infant, so it is helpful to shorten the phase by waiting until the body is ready. Once you feel the urge to push (which might feel like you need to produce a bowel movement), push in whatever way feels natural as the urge comes. It is not necessary to sustain pushing for long periods or to hold one's breath as this can tire you out and cause distress in the baby. Once the urge to push leaves, rest and breathe deeply before the next urge comes.  If baby needs to be delivered quickly, changing positions will usually allow them to rotate and come more quickly.  Being upright or on hands and knees can help as gravity will assist the baby in coming down."}
{"question": "How effective are epidurals during childbirth?", "answer": "Reasoning: Epidurals during childbirth may not always work. Epidurals may not completely eliminate pain during childbirth. There may be some sensation or movement even with an epidural during childbirth. There are potential side effects of epidurals in childbirth. The effects of an epidural may not last indefinitely.\nAnswer: An epidural is a very effective choice for pain management both during labor and afterwards if the parent requires stitches.  They allow you to rest if labor is long, and leave you alert and awake when it is time to push so you can be an active participant in delivery.  They can be started at any point during labor, though it is usually recommended to wait until you are in active labor (past 6cm) so that they don't slow down progress."}
{"question": "How long should I wait to pump or feed after drinking a cup of coffee?", "answer": "Reasoning: Caffeine from coffee can enter breastmilk after a certain amount of time. There is a delay between drinking coffee and the caffeine affecting breastmilk. There may be concerns about the safety of caffeine in breastmilk for the baby.\nAnswer: As long as you are drinking within the suggested amount daily (2 cups or less), you are generally fine to nurse or pump whenever you would like. If you notice that your baby reacts negatively to caffeine in the form of irritability or restlessness, you can have your coffee right after feeding baby as caffeine takes 1-2 hours to reach maximum levels in the parents body.  This will ensure that the amount of caffeine in your system will be diminishing when it is time for baby to come and feed again."}
{"question": "Can I request for an IV to be placed in the crook of my arm instead of my wrist?", "answer": "Reasoning: The nurses in the hospital may or may not listen to my requests for specific IV placement. There may be advantages and disadvantages to having an IV placed in the crook of my arm versus my wrist or hand. The same size and types of IVs may be used in the wrist and the crook of my arm. There may be a need to have an IV placed in my arm at the hospital.\nAnswer: You can absolutely request a line be placed in the crook of your arm. It might be preferable to ask for a placement in your forearm though, if you are trying to avoid your wrist or hand.  Placement in the forearm allows the laboring parent to move freely without kinking the line, which is a frequent occurrence when placed in the crook of the arm.  When this happens, the machine will make a beeping sound which can be distracting and frustrating during labor.  Having an IV in the crook of your arm is also difficult postpartum when trying to hold your newborn."}
{"question": "Is it bad for my 4-month-old baby to sleep in a noisy environment during the day?", "answer": "Reasoning: If my baby sleeps when it's loud, they may have difficulty sleeping when it's quiet. High noise levels during the day can negatively impact my baby's sleep quality. Consistent exposure to high levels of noise during the day can be detrimental to my baby's health and sleep quality. Sleeping in a noisy environment during the day may have a soothing effect on my baby. My baby may have difficulty sleeping during the night if they are accustomed to sleeping in a noisy environment during the day. There may be a threshold of noise that is too much for my baby to sleep through and be around. It may be beneficial for my baby to be\nAnswer: As long as your baby is sleeping in a quiet, dark, and safe place during evening sleep, it is ok for them to nap in a noisy environment during the day if there is no alternative.  While we like to have consistency to teach good sleep hygiene, there has not been any evidence that napping during a noisy environment is detrimental to infants if they are able to sleep through the noise."}
{"question": "How much spit up is too much for my baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: Spitting up after every meal is normal. There is a certain amount at which spit up is considered vomiting. There is a normal frequency at which a baby should be spitting up. There is a difference between spit up and throwing up in terms of amount and characteristics. Spitting up a lot may be normal for a baby.\nAnswer: Volumes are hard to determine when infants are spitting up, so it is generally advised to look at the consistency, frequency, and nature of the spitting episodes as well as how your infant tolerates them.  If your baby is gaining well, is not bothered by spitting, and it is not forceful in nature, this is common.  If baby is having difficulty gaining weight, is bothered or crying during or after spitting episodes or if they have ever choked on their spit up, talk to your doctor about finding out the root cause of their reflux, including a rule out for airway or gastrointestinal disorders."}
{"question": "Should I push to be tested for pre-eclampsia if I have protein in my urine and other symptoms?", "answer": "Reasoning: Protein in urine may be a sign of pre-eclampsia. The presence of other symptoms, in addition to protein in urine, may indicate pre-eclampsia. Headaches, abdominal pain, protein in urine, high blood pressure, and certain lab values can be used to diagnose pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is dangerous for both the mother and the baby. Testing for pre-eclampsia should be done early and regularly. Protein in urine is an early sign of pre-eclampsia and further testing can help catch it early for proper monitoring and treatment. Pre-eclampsia can\nAnswer: If you have protein in your urine and high blood pressure, your midwife or obstetrician should be checking you for pre-eclampsia.   Additional bloodwork and urinalysis is appropriate as well as a possible ultrasound or non-stress test.  If you do not feel comfortable with the care you are receiving, you may transfer your care to a different provider."}
{"question": "Is it safe to bring my 8 week old baby to a dinner party?", "answer": "Reasoning: The immune system of a newborn may not be strong enough to go out in public until a certain age. The immune system of a newborn may not be strong enough to be around an intimate group of people until a certain age. There may be certain vaccines that guests should have if a baby is brought to a dinner party. There are precautions that should be taken when introducing an 8 week old baby to people for the first time. Taking an 8 week old baby to a dinner party may disrupt their sleeping or feeding schedule.\nAnswer: While it is a personal call on whether you feel comfortable bringing an 8 week old to a public gathering, it is generally recommended that infants that have not received their first vaccines have limited visitors as their immune system is still not strong enough to be exposed on a greater level.  When in public or at a gathering, you are not able to screen whether people are sick or not and might accidentally expose your newborn to a dangerous illness."}
{"question": "How can I increase my milk supply?", "answer": "Reasoning: My milk supply may be low and I need to increase it. If I do not increase my milk supply, my baby may not be fed enough. There are supplements, vitamins, and foods that I can consume to increase my milk supply. There are prescription medications that I can take to increase my milk supply. Working with a lactation consultant can help me increase my milk supply. Increasing feeding and pumping may cause more milk to be produced. There could be something wrong with my baby or my breasts that is causing reduced milk supply.\nAnswer: It would depend if and why your milk supply is low.  The number one reason that supply is low is inadequate stimulation and draining of the breasts.  In the first 2 weeks, you need to fully drain your breasts either by nursing or pumping at least 8 times in a 24 hour period for at least 15-20 minutes.  If you are exclusively pumping, it is important to be properly fitted for a flange using a ruler and testing different sizes to ensure proper stimulation.  After the first 2 weeks, if you are still experiencing low supply even though you are nursing or pumping frequently, it can be helpful to seek advice from an IBCLC.  Some common causes for low supply outside of inadequate stimulation include: retained placenta, postpartum hemorrhage, hormonal imbalances (including postpartum thyroiditis), poor diet and herbs that can be counterproductive for some people (including common galactagogues which are herbal supplements to increase supply)."}
{"question": "How important is weight-loss before pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: Pregnancies in overweight people may be considered high risk. Pregnancies in obese people may be considered high risk. There may be risks in pregnancy that arise from being overweight. Being overweight before becoming pregnant may result in having a large baby. It may be possible to workout/exercise during pregnancy. Being overweight may not prevent someone from becoming pregnant or having a healthy pregnancy.\nAnswer: Starting your pregnancy at a healthy weight is a great way to start your pregnancy off on the right foot.  While the number on the scale isn't everything, a healthy weight has been shown to decrease pregnancy risks such as gestational diabetes, preterm birth and high blood pressure. While BMI can give you a basic guideline for a healthy weight, it does not take into account muscle mass and fat.   The only way to know what a healthy weight is for you is to talk to you midwife or obstetrician."}
{"question": "Is it okay for my 10 month old to have a strict breastmilk diet?", "answer": "Reasoning: I can breastfeed for as long as my baby and my milk supply will allow. Breastmilk has all the nutrients my growing baby could need at any age. At some point my baby needs to transition to eating solid food. Strict breastfeeding could impact my baby's nutrition and dental health. At ten months old, there may be foods that are necessary to be introduced if I am still breastfeeding. There may be potential consequences to not offering solid foods by the 4 to 6 month mark for my breastfed baby. There may be potential changes to my milk supply if I start incorporating solid foods into my 10 month old's diet\nAnswer: If your baby is not taking solids by 9 months, it is advised to talk to your pediatrician.  While some babies can take longer to get comfortable taking solid food, the low zinc and iron in breastmilk necessitates the introduction of solids around the middle of the first year of life.  Without the introduction of solids, infants might need to be supplemented with vitamins and minerals.  The majority of their calories should come from breastmilk or formula for the first year old life, but an infant of 10 months should be taking at least 3 meals daily or 3-4 tablespoons per meal."}
{"question": "Is it bad to use different bottles/nipples during feedings?", "answer": "Reasoning: Infants may experience nipple confusion if given different bottles or nipples for feeding. Using different bottles or nipples for feeding may compromise the baby's latch. Babies may notice if a different bottle or nipple is used for feeding.\nAnswer: As long as your baby will take each nipple and eats in a paced, controlled manner by an adult (do not prop bottles), then it is fine to use different nipples and bottles.  Always look for signs that your baby is having a hard time with a particular bottle.  Gagging, spitting up more, choking, or rejecting the bottle are signs that it the flow is too fast and the baby needs help with pacing themselves."}
{"question": "How does stress affect pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: Stress can have a negative impact on both the mother and the baby during pregnancy. Cortisol in the mother's blood can reach the baby through the placenta. There are some anti-anxiety/depression medications that are safe to take during pregnancy and are recommended. Experiencing a lot of stress during pregnancy may harm the baby. It is possible to be diagnosed with postpartum depression or anxiety while still pregnant. Having anxiety and depression before pregnancy may cause problems for the mother or the baby during pregnancy. Continuing anxiety and depression treatment while pregnant may be possible. Cortisol in the mother's blood passes through the placenta\nAnswer: Chronic stress can lead to both physical and mental health issues in the pregnant parent, which can in turn affect their unborn child.  Stress can lead to high blood pressure, which can lead to pre-eclampsia, and stress has also been shown to be a determining factor in premature delivery.  How we handle stress can be detrimental to our health as well.  Smoking, over or under eating, or taking illicit street drugs can all cause great harm to both the pregnant parent and the baby.  Talk to your midwife or OB about your level of stress and how to cope and manage during your pregnancy."}
{"question": "Can pregnancy tests be trusted?", "answer": "Reasoning: Urine pregnancy tests have a high false positive rate and should be followed up with a doctor's visit. The urine pregnancy test at a doctor's office is more accurate than the one bought at a drug store. There is potential for user error in an at home pregnancy test. Tests that are not given by a doctor or nurse should not be trusted. The technology behind pregnancy tests has been rigorously tested and is a good first step to identifying pregnancy when taken at the right time and as directed. There may be differences in accuracy between pregnancy tests bought from a drug store and those given at a doctor's office. Blood pregnancy tests may be more\nAnswer: Home pregnancy tests, when used properly, are very accurate in detecting if there is HCG in urine.  HCG doubles very quickly in the first weeks of pregnancy.  If taken at least once week after the first day of your missed period, it should be enough time to detect the HCG.  If you get a negative result, you can wait another week to retest.  False positives are rare and are usually due to medications containing HCG (including fertility medication) or are due to a recent pregnancy loss."}
{"question": "Can the sugar drink for the gestational diabetes test cause a yeast infection?", "answer": "Reasoning: High blood sugar can cause yeast infections. There is a potential risk of developing a yeast infection from drinking the sugar drink for GDM. There may be potential side effects associated with drinking the sugar drink for GDM. If someone is prone to yeast infections, they may want to avoid drinking the sugar drink for GDM.\nAnswer: High blood sugar (over 250 mg/dL) for a sustained period of time has been shown to increase the susceptibility of getting a yeast overgrowth or yeast infection.  This is common in uncontrolled diabetes and can be an early sign of undiagnosed diabetes.  If you got a yeast infection after doing the glucose tolerance test, and your blood sugar was elevated, it is likely that you might have already had a yeast infection that was starting and your undiagnosed diabetes was a contributing factor.  There is no evidence that the drink itself would cause a yeast infection."}
{"question": "Is 6 weeks too early for baby to sleep in his own room?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a point at which it is safe for a baby to start sleeping in their own separate room. There may be concerns about missing hunger cues and cries if a baby has their own room at 6 weeks. If a baby continues to sleep in the same room after 6 weeks, they may not learn to self-soothe. If a baby has their own room at 6 weeks, they may be able to learn to self-soothe. It may be safe for a baby to have their own room at any age as long as the parent can check in for hunger cues and hear them if they need\nAnswer: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants room in (sleep in the same room on a separate surface) with their caregivers for the first 6 months to decrease the likelihood of sleep-related deaths. When an infant is in the same room as it's caregivers for sleep, they can be aware to any changes in the baby's positioning or breathing and can tend to them quickly when they wake."}
{"question": "Will stress during pregnancy harm my baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: Stress during pregnancy can have a negative impact on the mother and baby. Cortisol in the mother's blood can reach the baby through the placenta. There are some anti-anxiety/depression medications that are safe to take during pregnancy. Too much stress during pregnancy can lead to a diagnosis of anxiety or depression. Untreated stress during pregnancy can make the delivery and postpartum period more difficult for the mother and baby. Postpartum depression can affect bonding with the baby. If stress levels cannot be controlled during pregnancy, it may harm the baby. It is possible to be diagnosed with postpartum depression or anxiety while still pregnant\nAnswer: Unresolved stress can lead to premature birth and can contribute to low birth weight, both of which increase the risk of complications for your baby.  While typical stress is common during pregnancy, stress related to negative life events (divorce, illness, or death in the family), catastrophic events (earthquakes, refugee status), and long-term stress (unstable living environment, abuse, financial instability) has been shown to be the most detrimental.  It is beneficial to have a good support network, nourishing yourself with good food, exercise and appropriate sleep, and seek help if you are feeling overwhelmed."}
{"question": "What's the difference between normal newborn crying and colic?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a difference between normal newborn crying and colic. There are symptoms that can help identify if a baby has colic. The cry of a baby with colic may sound different than a normally crying baby. Recognizing the cry and symptoms of a baby with colic is important. If a baby cannot be soothed, it may be colic. Colic is a common cause of newborn crying. Newborns cry frequently, but in most cases it is normal.\nAnswer: Colic is defined as a baby's crying lasting more than 3 hours, more than 3 days a week, for more than 3 weeks at a time. Unlike normal newborn crying, crying from a baby who has colic is not soothed by typical measures such as feeding, changing, temperature regulation, and swaddling. These babies tend to have excess gas, difficulty adjusting to the new sensations in the world, and are generally higher needs even when not crying.  Colic usually resolves between 3-6 months after birth."}
{"question": "Is it harmful to sleep on your back during the first trimester of pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are appropriate sleeping positions for the first trimester of pregnancy. Sleeping on your back may not be an appropriate sleeping position in the first trimester. There is a risk of compressing blood vessels if you lay on your back in the first trimester. There is a recommended duration for laying on your back in the first trimester to avoid harm.\nAnswer: Laying on your back for brief periods of time during pregnancy is generally safe, especially in the first trimester when the fetus is not very heavy. It is during your second and third trimesters where sleeping on your back can put pressure on a major blood vessel which can slow blood flow to the baby and make you dizzy. American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology encourage all pregnant people to sleep on their side."}
{"question": "How often should I give saline solution to my congested 3-month-old baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a possibility of giving a 3-month-old baby too much saline solution if they are congested. There are appropriate intervals in which saline solution can be given to a congested 3-month-old baby. If the saline solution is not given often enough to a congested 3-month-old baby, they may have trouble breathing. Administering the saline solution too many times to a congested three-month-old baby may have negative consequences.\nAnswer: You can put 1-2 drops of saline in each nostril, wait 30-60 seconds and use a bulb syringe to clear your infants passages before each feed if you feel their stuffiness will interfere with feeding.  You may also repeat this before naps or nighttime sleep.  If your infants develops a fever, is too stuffy to eat or sleep properly, or is stuffy for more than 2 weeks, contact your pediatrician."}
{"question": "What kinds of tests do they run and when throuout the pregnancy do they do them?", "answer": "Reasoning: My doctor or midwife will order lab tests for me when I become pregnant. There will be blood tests ordered for me throughout my pregnancy. There will be urine tests done throughout my pregnancy. I will have my first ultrasound after discovering I am pregnant. I will have multiple ultrasounds throughout my pregnancy. There is a test that tells me the sex of my baby. I may have to drink a glucose drink for a test during my pregnancy. There is a timeline for when all testing is performed throughout a pregnancy. I may have to consent to certain labs being drawn on me. I may have\nAnswer: There are many tests run during pregnancy to ensure that things are going well.  They will be based on many factors, but the following tests are routine.  In the first trimester: A complete blood count and blood type/rh factor test as well as testing for hepatitis B and C, HIV, and other sexually transmitted diseases; a urine test to look for infection, glucose and protein and an ultrasound to figure out a due date.  In the second trimester: Genetic testing with your consent and a growth scan which is a longer ultrasound whose aim is to have a detailed examination of your baby, placenta and amniotic fluid.  In the third trimester, you will be tested for gestational diabetes, have a vaginal swab for Group B Strep to make sure your baby isn't exposed if you are positive, and additional testing if your pregnancy is high risk."}
{"question": "Are cervix checks necessary during pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: Cervical checks may be uncomfortable and cause cramping. Cervical checks may cause spotting or light bleeding. Cervical checks may be done in or out of the hospital depending on the pregnancy and labor. Cervical checks have the potential to introduce bacteria into the baby's environment or uterus. It is possible to deny cervical checks during pregnancy. There may be circumstances in which a cervical check is required. It may be possible to have a cervical check only in the event of an emergency. Cervical checks gather information for the doctor or midwife.\nAnswer: According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, cervical checks during pregnancy are not not necessary unless you are having complications that suggest that you might be in premature labor, have an infection, or are experiencing heavy bleeding.  If you are postdates (past 40 weeks), your OB or midwife might suggest a cervical check to see if you are a good candidate for induction.  If you have a history of preterm labor or other complications, your care provider might suggest cervical checks more regularly."}
{"question": "How can I prepare for successful breastfeeding with my second child?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breastfeeding was difficult the first time. Breastfeeding may be harder the second time. Expressing colostrum at the end of pregnancy can help start breastfeeding after delivery. Seeing a lactation consultant may be beneficial for breastfeeding success. There are lactation consultants available near me. There may be considerations for breastfeeding a second child that didn't apply to the first pregnancy. It may not be necessary to wait until after the baby is born to speak to a breastfeeding specialist. There may be items to purchase in order to be fully ready to begin breastfeeding with the second baby. There may be recommended books and materials to prepare for successful breastfeeding\nAnswer: The best way to prepare for a successful nursing relationship with a subsequent pregnancy is to meet with an IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant) prior to the birth to discuss your medical history, your experience with your first child and what you would like to do differently this time. They can come up with a care plan that is specific to you and your situation. Taking a prenatal breastfeeding class is a highly recommended."}
{"question": "When can I introduce water to my 5 and a half month old?", "answer": "Reasoning: Giving water too early can cause problems for digestion and nutrient absorption in babies. Giving water to a dehydrated and hot baby is the best thing to do. Water can be given as a supplement as long as the baby is being fed regularly. Giving water too early can dilute nutrients in the baby's blood. There is a specific age at which it is considered too early to give water to a baby. Giving water to a baby is not recommended until they are 6 months old.\nAnswer: It is strongly recommended to wait until 6 months to introduce water to infants and even then only in small amounts (a sip here and there).  Human milk or formula (when prepared properly) contains all of the water that your baby needs to be healthy.  Giving additional water could cause them to be too full to feed properly when it's time to nurse or get a bottle.  A bigger concern though is that too much water can throw off their electrolytes and cause their kidneys to get overwhelmed.  This can lead to serious symptoms such as seizures and there are reports of coma and permanent brain damage is severe cases."}
{"question": "How long should I let my 2 week old cry for?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a recommended time to soothe a crying 2 week old. It may not be good to let a newborn cry for a while. There is a potential for a baby to learn to self soothe if allowed to cry at 2 weeks old. There is a potential for a baby to experience trauma, bonding issues, or abandonment issues if allowed to cry for too long at 2 weeks old. If I have tried everything to console my baby and they are still crying, it may be harmful to let them cry without ceasing.\nAnswer: Infants do not have spoken language and cry to let us know that they have needs.  The best way to handle crying in your newborn is to respond promptly to their needs.  You cannot spoil them and by responding promptly your baby understands that their needs will be meet appropriately.  This can help them to cry less overall."}
{"question": "Is it safe for my husband to have his tools in the cab along with our 8-month-old in the car seat?", "answer": "Reasoning: If my husband wrecks the car with his tools in it and our 8-month-old, then the tools could cause harm to my husband or my baby. Loose tools could fly around if he slams on the breaks too hard and hit my baby. My baby might be able to reach the tools and hurt themselves. Babies may be able to escape out of their car seats and injure themselves inside vehicles. There are certain items that should not be in the car when my baby is in it. There are certain items that should be kept out of reach when my baby is in their car seat.\nAnswer: Any loose item in a vehicle can become dangerous in the instance of a crash or a situation where the brakes must be applied quickly and with force.  Hard toys, tools, and any object came become projectile during these situations.  While your baby will be safe in their car seat if properly installed, you cannot control where an object will fly and tools could seriously injure your child."}
{"question": "Should I bring my breast pump to the hospital when getting induced?", "answer": "Reasoning: I want to start producing milk right away in case I cannot breastfeed my baby. I do not want to breastfeed and want to start pumping as soon as possible. Using a breast pump can be a method of induction to start contractions. Using a breast pump may be the only way to start labor without medication. I can use my own breast pump at the hospital or they may have one I can use. Using a breast pump may start my contractions. I can bring my own breast pump to the hospital to start my induction. Using a breast pump (either my own or the hospital's) may be my only method of induction\nAnswer: At most hospitals, there are breast pump rentals if you need to use a pump while you are inpatient.  If you are planning to nurse and only pump occasionally and your hospital has rentals, you don't need to bring your personal pump with you.  If you are expecting to exclusively pump though or would like help understanding how to use your pump, it might be helpful to bring it with you so the nurses can help you."}
{"question": "Is there a way to prevent postpartum depression?", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be a way to prevent postpartum depression. There are screening tools available to detect postpartum depression. There is an earliest time at which screening for postpartum depression can be done. There may be things that can be done to lower the chances of developing postpartum depression. There may be factors that predispose someone to postpartum depression that can be changed. There may be some risk factors for postpartum depression that are within someone's control.\nAnswer: Having a plan in place for the first weeks will help you to not become overwhelmed by this big shift in your life, which can kick of mood disorders even for people with no history of mental health concerns.  Figuring out who will take on what chores, knowing which friends you can rely on for help and focusing on the basics of good food, gentle exercise and rest are solid ways to plan for a smoother transition postpartum. Knowing the signs of postpartum depression is also key to being able to catch it very early before it becomes overwhelming.  Signs include anxiety, overwhelming sad thoughts, lack of interest in things you previously enjoyed, feeling unable to care for your infant, and irritability."}
{"question": "What symptoms should I worry for after a fall?", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be some symptoms that I should expect to see after a fall. I may not need to go to the hospital right away after a fall. There are certain circumstances in which I should call my doctor after a fall. There is a way to know if my fall is severe or not. I may not need to go to the hospital after every fall or accident.\nAnswer: Luckily a fetus is well protected by thick uterine walls, muscles and amniotic fluid making most falls during pregnancy scary but not immediately dangerous to the fetus.  Falls during the second and third trimester are at greater risk of harm, especially if you fall or hit your abdomen.  Get emergency care if you are bleeding or leaking fluid from your vagina, feel pain, tenderness or contractions in your abdomen or if you don't feel movement from your baby. Your care provider might want to run tests to make sure everything is fine, so call your healthcare team with any concerns."}
{"question": "Is it safe for my 10 week old to sleep through the night?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a certain interval at which a 10-week-old baby needs to be fed. It may not be safe to let a 10-week-old baby sleep through the night without waking up to feed. Hunger cues and the baby waking up on their own may not be reliable indicators of when to feed a 10-week-old baby. Feeding right before bed and first thing in the morning may not be sufficient to allow the baby to sleep through the night. There may be potential negative consequences if a 10-week-old baby skips their night feedings.\nAnswer: As long as your baby is gaining appropriately (0.5-1 oz per day), stooling daily, having at least 5 heavy wet diapers and is feeding at least 7 times a day, then they are fine to sleep as long as they would like.  If you are breastfeeding, it is important to not go longer than 6 hours, as you will be very uncomfortable and run the risk of infection and decreased supply.  If your baby wants to sleep longer than that, chat with an IBCLC on how to manage discomfort.  If you are formula feeding, as long as you get the proper amount of ounces into baby during the day time, the AAP states that babies are fine to go without feeding overnight.  Frequent wake ups are developmentally normal though and you should expect your infant to wake multiple times a night."}
{"question": "How can you tell if you have postpartum depression (PPD)?", "answer": "Reasoning: Postpartum depression is a condition that can be diagnosed by a healthcare provider. There are specific questions that a provider may ask to determine if someone has PPD. There is a screening test available for PPD. PPD has specific symptoms that differentiate it from the baby blues. PPD may feel different from regular depression. PPD has a specific timeframe in which it starts and ends after delivery. It is important to differentiate between the baby blues and PPD. Feeling sad, anxious, and having a constant feeling of dread may be symptoms of PPD.\nAnswer: Mood swings, crying spells, anxiety and difficulty sleeping are common after having a baby.  Starting within the first 2 or 3 days, these feelings can last for up to two weeks and are commonly known as \"baby blues.\" When it lasts longer than this or consists of more severe symptoms, it is known as postpartum depression.  Symptoms might include: crying often, difficulty bonding with baby, withdrawing from friends and family, changes in appetite, mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.  If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, talk to a trusted friend and reach out to your care provider."}
{"question": "What happens at the 16 week appointment?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are tests and milestones that can be expected at a 16 week appointment. There is advice that doctors often give at a 16 week appointment. There may or may not be an ultrasound at a 16 week appointment. The 16 week appointment is important in pregnancy. I will have all sorts of tests at my 16 week appointment. I can not miss my 16 week appointment with my doctor. There is a test that I do not want to do at my 16 week appointment. I desire an ultrasound at my 16 week appointment.\nAnswer: At your 16 week appointment, your care provider will check your blood pressure and weight, listen to baby's heartbeat and review additional screenings that can be done in the second trimester.  If you had genetic testing in your first trimester, you might also discuss the results of those tests and will do the second part of those screenings.  You will also make an appointment for an anatomy scan, a longer, separate ultrasound appointment to check on baby's growth and development."}
{"question": "Is milk supply always supply and demand based?", "answer": "Reasoning: Milk supply is not always supply and demand based. There are factors that can affect milk supply. Feeding more may not necessarily result in producing more milk. Feeding less or less often may result in a decrease in milk supply. There are things that can be done to increase or decrease milk supply. A decrease in milk supply does not necessarily mean that the baby is trying to wean off.\nAnswer: There are many factors that can influence milk volume, but adequate stimulation or demand, is necessary to keep milk supply steady.  Each time the baby or a pump stimulates the breasts and extracts the milk, it signals to the brain that supply needs to stay high.  If demand decreases, then supply will decrease over time.  Hormonal, anatomical and other medical issues with the lactating parent can influence the overall volume of milk, but adequate demand is necessary for the body to produce as much milk as it can."}
{"question": "How can I increase the time between feedings for my 3-month-old baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a way to try and space out feedings for a baby. It may be possible to sleep through the night while still ensuring the baby is fed. Increasing the time between feedings may have an impact on milk supply or the baby. Spacing out feedings for a 3-month-old baby may be challenging.\nAnswer: At three months, the average full term infant feeds every 2-4 hours whether breast or bottle fed.  It is important that babies feed frequently and smaller volumes allow baby to realize when they are full and prevents overfeeding.  If your 3 month old feeds more often than every 3 hours and is inconsolable or having trouble with weight gain, talk to your pediatrician and seek help from a skilled lactation consultant (IBCLC) if you are breastfeeding or pumping.  An IBCLC can help you find the root cause of your baby's frequent if it is outside of normal limits even if you are combination feeding."}
{"question": "Is white discharge a sign of pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: If I notice more white discharge, it might be a sign of pregnancy. There are reasons other than pregnancy that might cause white discharge. White discharge might be a concerning symptom.\nAnswer: White discharge is common during every stage of an adult female's life as long as it is thin, clear or milky in color, and does not have a strong smell.  An increase in discharge can be a sign of pregnancy, especially if your period is late and you are experiencing other symptoms such as tender breasts, increased fatigue and cravings or distaste for certain foods."}
{"question": "Can you choose to have a C-Section without medical necessity?", "answer": "Reasoning: I do not want to deliver a baby vaginally. I want to avoid tearing my perineum and protect my pelvic floor from injury. I believe I am healthy and can heal well from a c-section. A doctor may have financial incentives to perform an elective c-section. I want to have control over the timing of my baby's birth. C-sections can be performed without medical necessity. C-sections are not only for emergencies. There are risks and benefits associated with delivering via c-section versus vaginally. C-sections can be performed based on personal choice.\nAnswer: Yes, you can choose to have a c-section without medical necessity.  Your obstetrician will want to have a discussion to explore the reasons for your request and to discuss the risks and benefits of a planned surgical birth.  If there are no reasons for an early delivery, it will be recommended to wait until at least 39 weeks gestation."}
{"question": "Do breastfed babies only need 4 oz of milk?", "answer": "Reasoning: A newborn's stomach can only hold a certain amount of breastmilk. There is a recommended amount of breastmilk that a newborn needs to eat in one feed. 4oz of breastmilk may not be too much or too little for a baby to consume. Breastmilk may be more nutrient or calorie dense than formula. 4oz of breastmilk may be enough to make a baby full after feeding. Breastfed babies can consume 4oz or less per feed and still be well fed.\nAnswer: Once baby is 10 pounds, they will take anywhere from 24-28 ounces of breastmilk on average in a 24 hour period.  In the first 2 months, they feed an average of 8-12 times a day, giving a volume of roughly 2-3 ounces per feed.  As they get older, they tend to consolidate their feeds to every 3-4 hours with a longer stretch at night, taking in between 3-5 ounces per feed.  Though they can take in more, larger volumes can lead to tummy upset and spitting and can encourage baby to ignore their hunger and fullness cues."}
{"question": "What is the right ratio of oatmeal to formula for a 4-month-old?", "answer": "Reasoning: Adding oatmeal is a good choice to introduce new foods and textures to my baby. There is a specific ratio of oatmeal to formula that is safe for my 4-month-old. My baby is ready to start consuming thicker (solid) foods at 4 months old. There is a way to know how much oatmeal to add to formula for my 4-month-old.\nAnswer: Giving any cereal before 6 months is generally not recommended, with the exception of infants with diagnosed reflux or dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). At the 6 month mark, you can mix 1 tbsp of oatmeal with 4 tbsp (60 ml) of formula for baby, offering one to two teaspoons at a time.  Never add any cereal to baby's bottle without express instruction from your pediatrician."}
{"question": "Is it possible to develop allergies to certain foods during pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: Pregnancy can cause changes in the immune system. It is normal to develop new food allergies when becoming pregnant. Pregnancy can affect the immune system. There is a possibility of developing new food allergies while pregnant. New food allergies can be a result of being pregnant. Food allergies that occur during pregnancy may resolve after delivery.\nAnswer: Anytime there is a hormonal fluctuation in your body, allergies can be triggered. It is common for new allergies to emerge during periods of intense hormonal shift such as during puberty and pregnancy.  The body is also in a heightened immune state during pregnancy, making you more susceptible to new allergies as the body can over-react in an attempt to to keep the fetus safe."}
{"question": "What is the best way to sit up after a C-section?", "answer": "Reasoning: If I sit up incorrectly after a c-section, it can cause problems with my incision. There is a way to sit up after a c-section that is less painful. There is a way to sit up after a c-section that will protect my incision. It may be okay to sit up after a c-section. I may not need to have a binder on in order to sit up after a c-section.\nAnswer: The safest way to sit up after a c-section is the \"log roll\" method.  If you are on your back, roll fully onto your side with your knees bent.  Using your arms, slowly push yourself into a seated position while keeping your abdomen as relaxed as possible.  Once you are seated, you can either stand or gently scoot yourself into a more comfortable seated position supported by pillows."}
{"question": "Can a normal pregnancy become ectopic?", "answer": "Reasoning: Until my doctor sees on the ultrasound that my pregnancy is in the right place, it can still become ectopic. Even a normal pregnancy can move around and become ectopic until it attaches to the uterine wall. There are many places a growing pregnancy can end up growing, such as the cervix or fallopian tubes. These growing pregnancies can be either normal or abnormal in genetic makeup. If an ectopic pregnancy occurs, it may be because it was an abnormal fetus/pregnancy.\nAnswer: An ectopic pregnancy is one where the fertilized egg grows outside the uterus.  The most common place for an ectopic pregnancy is in a fallopian tube. An embryo that is in the uterus cannot move outside of the uterus, or become ectopic, once it is implanted in the lining of the uterine wall."}
{"question": "When can I start building a stash of pumped breast milk?", "answer": "Reasoning: I am unsure about my milk supply and want to take every opportunity to keep my baby fed and my supply plentiful, and pumping as soon as I can will help. I need to start early to prepare a stash of extra breastmilk for when I go back to work. If I am separated from my baby after birth for some reason, I will need a stash of breastmilk to give. I already know breastfeeding is not for me, but I want to feed my baby right away and pumping as soon as I can will help. The earliest I can begin pumping is a specific time. It may be possible to collect colostr\nAnswer: It is best in the first month to allow baby to dictate how much milk they need by nursing frequently (every two to three hours) and fully.  Once supply has been established, around 6 weeks, and baby is gaining well, you can start pumping regularly to build a stash of milk.  Pumping before then to build a stash is not recommended as it can cause your body to overproduce, which can be painful for you and make the flow difficult to handle for your baby. It is generally advised to pump once or twice a day for 15-20 minutes after baby feeds. More milk will be extracted overnight or early in the morning."}
{"question": "Are prenatal vitamins optional or necessary?", "answer": "Reasoning: Prenatal vitamins are necessary for the growth and success of my pregnancy. It may be possible to get all the necessary vitamins and minerals through a healthy diet during pregnancy. Taking folic acid alone may not be sufficient and a prenatal vitamin may still be necessary. If I have morning sickness and can't keep anything down, not taking a prenatal vitamin may harm my baby. If morning sickness doesn't last long, there may not be any negative consequences from not taking a prenatal vitamin. My doctor or midwife may allow me to stop taking prenatal vitamins if I have a healthy diet. My doctor or midwife may allow me to stop taking prenatal\nAnswer: Prenatal vitamins ensure that the pregnant parent gets adequate nutrients needed for a healthy baby.  While a solid diet is very important, it can be hard to get in the appropriate amount of some nutrients by diet alone, especially if you are prone to morning sickness or have aversions to certain foods due to your pregnancy. Taking a daily prenatal vitamin can help prevent birth defects in baby and complications from nutrient deficiencies in the pregnant parent."}
{"question": "Will eating broccoli and Brussel sprouts make my baby gassy?", "answer": "Reasoning: What I eat can affect the contents of my breastmilk. There are certain foods that can cause GI or allergy symptoms in my baby. The thing that causes gassiness from broccoli and Brussel sprouts can make its way into breastmilk.\nAnswer: Though these myths have been prevalent for years, there is no solid evidence that eating certain foods will cause gas in breastfed infants outside of an allergy.  The most common allergies are dairy, soy, eggs, fish, peanuts, shellfish, sesame and wheat.  Broccoli and brussels sprouts cause gas when eaten because a certain sugar that is in them stays in your gut and becomes fermented, causing gas.  Since this sugar (raffinose) does not pass through breastmilk, it is physiologically impossible for these foods to cause gas in an infant that is not ingesting them directly."}
{"question": "when does a baby become viable outside the womb", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a point before 40 weeks at which babies can survive outside of the womb. There is a gestational age at which a baby is considered \"full term.\" There may be concerns when a baby is born early. There is a gestational age at which a baby is less likely to have complications related to gestational age.\nAnswer: In later pregnancy, a health care professional may use the term “viable” to indicate the chance for survival that a fetus has if delivered before it can fully develop in the uterus. During the periviable period, which is weeks 20 through 25 of pregnancy, rates of neonatal survival to discharge at this time range dramatically from 23%-27% for births at 23 weeks, 42% to 59% for births at 24 weeks, and 67% to 76% for births at 25 weeks of gestations. Deliveries before 23 weeks have only a 5-6% survival rate, and of those rare survivors, almost all have significant disease or medical conditions. Fetal viability depends on many complex factors, of which gestational age is only one. Other factors that influence viability are sex, genetics, weight, circumstances around delivery, and availability of a neonatal intensive care professional. Even with all available factors considered, it still isn't possible to definitively predict a fetus's survival. While some babies delivered during the periviable period can survive outside the womb, they may also experience significant disease and impairment. Some fetal conditions exist for which survivability will be poor regardless of when the pregnancy ends. No definite diagnosis of viability exists, and no test can definitely determine whether a fetus could survive outside of the womb. Determining whether a pregnancy is viable beyond the first trimester is often based on clinical judgment. While health care professionals cannot predict with certainty the outcome for an individual pregnancy or fetus, they can help patients understand their individual risks and circumstances so that they can make informed decisions for their pregnancy and their individual health."}
{"question": "what is normal weight of baby during birth", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a healthy range for the birthweight of a full-term baby. There is a point at which a baby is considered too small or too big. There are common causes for a baby to have a low birth weight. There are common causes for a baby to be larger than average. There are risks associated with low birth weight. There may be concerns for the mother's health if the baby is too big. There may be limitations on the size of a baby that can be birthed vaginally. There may be a need for the baby to be in the NICU if it is too small.\nAnswer: A healthy weight for a baby at birth can vary. Most babies born at term (between 37 and 40 weeks) weigh between 5 pounds, 8 ounces (2,500 grams) and 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams). Newborns who are lighter or heavier than average are usually healthy but may get extra attention from doctors and nurses after delivery to make sure no problems exist. One factor that can affect a baby's size at birth is the length of pregnancy. Babies born near their due date or later tend to be larger than those born earlier. Most babies born with low birth weight are born prematurely, or before 37 weeks of gestation. Other factors that can affect birth weight are the size of the parents, if the baby is part of a multiple birth, birth order, gender, mom's health during pregnancy, nutrition during pregnancy, and baby's health."}
{"question": "what stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone", "answer": "Reasoning: The corpus luteum is involved in the production of progesterone. The corpus luteum produces progesterone prior to a pregnancy. The corpus luteum produces progesterone after fertilization and implantation. The corpus luteum is necessary for maintaining a pregnancy. A miscarriage can occur if the corpus luteum dies.\nAnswer: The corpus luteum is a normal group of cells that forms on the ovary every month in women of childbearing age. It appears right after ovulation when an egg is released from the ovary. If the egg gets fertilized, and an embryo implants in the uterus, then a placenta will also begin to develop. The placenta is the organ that holds the developing fetus and produces the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone that makes the uterus a healthy environment for a developing fetus. The corpus luteum will continue to produce progesterone for about 12 weeks, at which point the placenta can start to produce enough progesterone to maintain the fetus, and the corpus luteum then regresses and breaks down."}
{"question": "when does the fetus begin to develop memory", "answer": "Reasoning: Fetuses have the ability to form memories. There is a stage in fetal development when memory begins to develop. Fetuses may be able to distinguish between memories. There is a way to know if a fetus can remember things. Fetuses may be able to remember different voices.\nAnswer: The ability to remember people and things dramatically increases in babies aged 8 to 12 months, but this is short-term memory. Long-term memory is different. Researchers have found that children have great difficulty recalling the past before 12 months of age because the brain is too immature to firmly register experiences. The brains of older babies have developed enough to record and retrieve memories of single distinctive experiences, such as playing a game they played months before. Most single experiences before the age of 8 months, unless very emotional or painful, are probably not remembered. Even though memory is not fully developed in infancy, experiences in early childhood are important in building and acquiring the development of memory. Memory is a complex cognitive ability that is important in many aspects of thinking and learning, including language, reading, following directions, problem solving, and imagining. For memories to become part of the child's life story and be real to them, there must first be a developed sense of self and personal identity. Children do not fully develop a sense of self until typically around 1 ½ or 2 years of age. Having a sense of self gives a place for the memory to be organized and develop personal meaning."}
{"question": "how does the placenta detaches from the uterus after birth", "answer": "Reasoning: The placenta should be delivered soon after birth. There may be some pain or discomfort when the placenta detaches from the uterus. There may be complications if the placenta does not detach by itself. Some women may have difficulty or complications delivering the placenta. The process of placenta detachment may be different for women who have a c-section.\nAnswer: When a baby is delivered vaginally, the placenta is also delivered vaginally after the baby is born, usually within 30 minutes. The uterus will naturally continue to contract to expel the placenta, and it might require one more push to deliver the placenta. Sometimes complications may arise during delivery of the placenta. A retained placenta might occur if contractions are not robust enough to completely expel the placenta or if all or part of the placenta remains attached to the uterine wall. The placenta may also become trapped behind a partially closed cervix. To assist in the delivery of the placenta, your health care provider might administer a drug to continue uterine contractions and reduce bleeding. Massaging your lower abdomen can also encourage the uterus to contract and expel the placenta. Breastfeeding can also make the uterus contract and may be enough to expel the placenta. If delivery of the placenta takes longer than 30 minutes, heavy bleeding often results. Emergency surgery may be required as a last resort to remove a retained placenta and reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Surgery is also necessary in rare, severe cases such as placenta accreta, when the placenta has grown deeply embedded in the womb."}
{"question": "when does the anterior fontanelle close in babies", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies have a soft spot called the anterior fontanelle. There is a point at which the anterior fontanelle closes. There is a potential concern if the anterior fontanelle does not close by a certain point. The closing of the anterior fontanelle at a nonstandard time may indicate a health problem.\nAnswer: Fontanelles are the soft spaces on a baby's head where the skull bones have not yet fused together. The anterior fontanelle is located near the front, top of a baby's head and usually closes between 7 and 18 months, while the posterior fontanelle, at the back of the head, usually closes within the first two months after birth. The fontanelle spaces allow for the skull bones to shift as needed during birth and for a baby's brain to grow. It is OK to lightly touch your baby's fontanelles; they should feel soft and flat. Premature babies or babies with ongoing medical conditions might have fontanelles that close on a different schedule. Talk to your baby's healthcare provider to understand when to expect your baby's fontanelles to close. If you feel your baby's fontanelles are closing too soon or haven't closed by 18 months, consult your pediatrician. Also, talk to your healthcare provider if you see a bulging or sunken fontanelle, which may be a sign of a health issue."}
{"question": "when do babies stop being afraid of strangers", "answer": "Reasoning: All babies experience discomfort around strangers. There are factors that cause babies to be uncomfortable around strangers. There are ways to help babies feel less afraid with new people. There are ways to promote healthy attachment for babies.\nAnswer: Anxiety around strangers is usually one of the first emotional milestones your baby will reach. During the ages of 8 to 9 months, babies might become anxious, clinging, easily frightened, and cry around unfamiliar people or objects. These behavior patterns occur because your baby is now able to tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar situations. The predictable anxieties during this stage of development are evidence of a healthy relationship with your baby. Stranger anxiety usually abates by the age of two years. Both the duration and the intensity of stranger anxiety vary greatly among children. Some infants and young children show a strong preference for one parent over another, or grandparents or caregivers may suddenly be viewed as strangers. Comforting the child and avoiding overreaction to the behavior are usually the only therapy needed to help the child during these situations. Stranger anxiety that lasts beyond the age of two or is very intense may be a sign of a more generalized anxiety that should be evaluated by a health care professional."}
{"question": "when does relaxin start being produced during pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: Relaxin is produced in the body during pregnancy. Relaxin is not produced until the third trimester. Relaxin causes the pelvic bones to separate. Relaxin is not present in the body before a woman gets pregnant.\nAnswer: Relaxin is a reproductive hormone that loosens and relaxes the muscles, joints, and ligaments during pregnancy to help the body stretch and accommodate a growing fetus and prevent early contractions by relaxing the uterine muscles. It also helps to prepare the body for delivery by loosening muscles and ligaments in the pelvis. Relaxin is produced by the ovaries even before pregnancy. Levels are low until ovulation, when it starts to rise to prepare the uterus for implantation. If conception occurs, relaxin levels stay high and continue to rise through the first trimester of pregnancy. The placenta also begins to produce relaxin during pregnancy. Relaxin levels in the body peak around 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. Then, levels decline for the remainder of pregnancy before surging just before delivery of the baby in order to relax the pelvic muscles and widen the cervix."}
{"question": "when does a baby's lungs start functioning", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies are not born with fully functioning lungs. There is a point in development when a baby's organs fully develop. Premature babies may have difficulty breathing if their lungs are not fully developed. There may be consequences if a baby is born before their lungs are fully developed.\nAnswer: During pregnancy, the lungs begin to develop during the first eight weeks of life and continue developing throughout the duration of a pregnancy. The rate of lung development can vary greatly, and the lungs are among the last organs to fully develop. Around week 25, the lungs are fully formed but not yet ready to function outside the uterus. Inside the mother's womb, the lungs are filled with fluid, and oxygen is supplied through the umbilical cord. By 37 weeks, the lungs are functional and ready to undergo their biggest change at birth, when they must quickly start breathing air to supply the baby with oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. The lungs of babies born before 37 weeks are usually not fully developed, which puts premature infants at risk for developing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Researchers have been able to make artificial surfactant as an effective treatment for babies with RDS."}
{"question": "what is a collapsed follicle in an ovary", "answer": "Reasoning: Follicles can collapse in the ovary. The corpus luteum is formed in the ovary. The body produces progesterone. Eggs burst from the follicle. Ovulation is a process that occurs.\nAnswer: A collapsed follicle occurs with normal ovulation, when one of the ovaries releases an egg from a follicle. The follicle physically collapses and becomes cloudy when viewed on ultrasound imaging. This collapsed follicle undergoes structural and functional transformation to become the corpus luteum, which releases the hormone progesterone to support pregnancy. In some cases, a follicular cyst may develop when a mature follicle collapses on itself."}
{"question": "when does a baby's vision fully develop", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a standard time for a baby's vision to fully develop. It may be harmful if a baby's vision does not develop. There may be something that can be done to ensure a baby's vision develops properly. There is a way in which vision develops in a fetus. There may be a point at which it is concerning if a baby's vision does not develop.\nAnswer: A baby's vision develops at his or her own rate, but the overall pattern of development is the same. Because a baby's vision develops quickly during the first year of life, a baby's pediatrician will check the eyes at each well-child visit. Once a baby is born, a baby's vision goes through many changes. Newborn infants generally have poor eyesight and little ability to focus beyond 6 or 10 inches away. Their eyes are very sensitive to bright light. Their central vision is still developing. Within a couple of weeks, they can start to see light and dark ranges and patterns and start to focus on objects right in front of them. The amount of color vision is not known for certain, but infants probably do not see subtle differences in color until two to three months of age. A baby's eyesight will improve as he or she grows and remains awake for longer periods of time. Around four to five months of age, a baby's eyes work together to develop depth perception, and a baby can see in three dimensions more completely. They also have improved color vision. By 12 months, a baby's vision reaches normal adult levels while he or she continues to explore and learn about the world. Even after the first year, regular eye exams with a health care provider are important to identify problems that may arise later in childhood."}
{"question": "what causes a rupture in the amniotic sac", "answer": "Reasoning: Ruptures in the amniotic sac can be dangerous for both the mother and the baby. There may be ways to prevent early amniotic sac rupture. The amniotic sac typically ruptures during birth. There are potential consequences if the amniotic sac ruptures. Amniotic sac rupture may not be common. There may be a possibility of preventing amniotic sac rupture. There is a possibility of amniotic sac rupture occurring early.\nAnswer: During pregnancy, your baby is surrounded and cushioned by a fluid-filled membranous sac called the amniotic sac. The fluid inside the amniotic sac is called the amniotic fluid. When the membranes of the amniotic sac rupture, amniotic fluid comes out of the vagina. This is known as your “water breaking” and is a sign that the baby will be delivered soon. In most cases, the membranes rupture during labor or within 24 hours before the start of labor. Your healthcare provider may even break your water for you, called an amniotomy. It is not clear what happens in a pregnant person's body to cause the amniotic sac to rupture. Experts think it may be caused by signals in the fetus's brain or from hormones that weaken the amniotic sac. If you are not already in labor and experiencing contractions, no other signs that your water is going to break exist."}
{"question": "when do the clinical manifestations of an ectopic pregnancy typically appear", "answer": "Reasoning: Ectopic pregnancies have clinical manifestations that can be identified. There is a way to know if I am having an ectopic pregnancy. There is a definition of an ectopic pregnancy. There are causes of an ectopic pregnancy. There is medical or surgical management for an ectopic pregnancy. There may be a way to prevent an ectopic pregnancy. There may be clinical manifestations of an ectopic pregnancy that do not appear early on. I may miss signs of an ectopic pregnancy.\nAnswer: An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the main cavity of the uterus. Most often, an ectopic pregnancy occurs in a fallopian tube, which usually carries eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. Sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy occurs in other areas such as the ovary, abdominal cavity, or cervix. The fertilized egg can't survive in areas other than the uterus, and an ectopic pregnancy cannot proceed normally. Healthcare professions typically diagnose ectopic pregnancies in the first trimester, within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Most people discover they have an ectopic pregnancy around week 8 of pregnancy. No symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy may be apparent at first; some women have the usual early signs of pregnancy, such as a missed period and nausea. An early warning sign of an ectopic pregnancy is light vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. Pain in the lower abdomen and lower back is also common. Some people feel shoulder pain or an urge to have a bowel movement, depending on where blood collects and which nerves are irritated. The fallopian tube may rupture and cause heavy bleeding inside the abdomen. Symptoms include extreme lightheadedness, low blood pressure, fainting, shock, and sudden, sharp lower abdominal pain. Without emergency treatment, a ruptured tube can be life-threatening."}
{"question": "what effect does an increase in luteinising hormone have on the endometrium", "answer": "Reasoning: The endometrium grows and changes throughout a woman's cycle. Luteinising hormone (LH) has an effect on a woman's cycle. An increase in LH may have an effect on the endometrium.\nAnswer: Luteinizing hormone (LH) spurs ovulation and helps with the production of the hormones progesterone and estrogen that are needed to support pregnancy in the uterus. In the brain, the pituitary gland releases LH during the ovulatory and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. An initial surge in LH during the ovulatory phase causes the release of an egg from the ovary, or ovulation. Then the during luteal phase, LH is released at a constant pace for two weeks, which stimulates the production of progesterone and estrogen hormones in the ovaries. Progesterone and estrogen prepare the uterus in case an embryo is implanted by causing the endometrium, or the lining of the uterus, to thicken and fill with fluids and nutrients to nourish a potential embryo."}
{"question": "when does a baby take its first breath", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies should take their first breath immediately after birth. There is a standard time at which babies should begin breathing on their own. It may be indicative of a health problem if a baby does not take their first breath at the standard time. There may be concerns if a baby's first breath doesn't happen immediately. Premature babies may not be able to take their first breath on their own. Babies cannot breathe in the womb. There is a point at which babies begin to breathe on their own.\nAnswer: Inside the mother's womb, the lungs are filled with fluid, and oxygen is supplied through the umbilical cord. By 37 weeks, an infant's lungs are fully functional and ready make the change to breathing air outside the womb. A baby takes its first breath just moments after birth, when the lungs quickly start breathing air to supply the baby with oxygen and expel carbon dioxide."}
{"question": "where does edema tend to occur in the pregnant woman's body", "answer": "Reasoning: Swelling is a normal occurrence during pregnancy. Swelling can occur in specific places of the body during pregnancy. There are factors that can worsen swelling during pregnancy. There are ways to prevent or reduce swelling during pregnancy. There may be times when swelling during pregnancy should be a cause for concern.\nAnswer: Swelling during pregnancy is normal because the body produces approximately 50% more blood and body fluids to meet the needs of the developing baby. This condition is called edema. Fluid may accumulate in tissues, usually in the feet, ankles, and lower legs, causing them to swell and appear puffy. Some fluid accumulation during pregnancy is normal, particularly around the fifth month and during the third trimester. Occasionally the fingers also have mild swelling, but severe swelling in the hands and feet as well as swelling in the face may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious health condition that can cause organ damage in the mother and health complications in the unborn baby. Other conditions that cause swelling are deep vein thrombosis and peripartum cardiomyopathy. If you have severe or sudden edema, especially swelling in the hands and face, seek medical attention immediately. Other warning signs include persistent headache, changes in vision, confusion, severe upper abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, and high blood pressure."}
{"question": "when does a baby lose their startle reflex", "answer": "Reasoning: All babies have a startle reflex. There is a cause for a baby's startle reflex. Babies lose their newborn reflexes at a certain point.\nAnswer: The Moro reflex is a type of involuntary response to stimulation that is one of the many normal reflexes present at birth. It is often called the startle reflex because it usually occurs when a baby is startled by a loud sound or movement. In response, the baby throws back his or her head, extends out his or her arms and legs, cries, and then pulls the arms and legs back in. Your baby's pediatrician will check for this reflex right after birth. It normally lasts until the baby is about two to four months old. A Moro reflex in an older infant or child is abnormal."}
{"question": "when is the first us done in pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a standard time for the first ultrasound to be done in pregnancy. Prenatal care should start at a certain time. The due date can be determined at a certain point in pregnancy. The baby's heartbeat can be heard at a certain point in pregnancy.\nAnswer: A prenatal ultrasound (or sonogram) is a test done in pregnancy to check on the health and development of your baby. Ultrasounds can help to determine how far along you are in pregnancy and to make sure your baby is growing properly. Other times, your pregnancy care provider might order an ultrasound to determine if there are any potential problems or medical conditions present in the pregnancy. Ultrasounds may occur at any time in pregnancy depending on what your health care provider needs to look for. Most pregnant people have one or two ultrasounds during pregnancy, one in the first trimester and one in the second trimester. The number and timing vary depending on your pregnancy care provider and if you have any health conditions. Some people have an early ultrasound as early as seven or eight weeks of pregnancy to confirm pregnancy, check for multiple fetuses, measure the size of the fetus, and help confirm gestational age and due date. The anatomy ultrasound is usually performed around 18 to 20 weeks in pregnancy. During this ultrasound, your pregnancy provider can see your baby's sex, detect birth disorders, and find any serious conditions related to your baby's organs."}
{"question": "when does a baby breathe for the first time", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies should take their first breath immediately after birth. There is a standard time when babies should begin breathing on their own. It may be indicative of a health problem if a baby does not take their first breath at the standard time. There may be concerns if a baby's first breath doesn't happen immediately. Premature babies may not be able to take their first breath on their own. Babies cannot breathe in the womb. There is a point at which babies begin to breathe on their own.\nAnswer: Inside the mother's womb, the lungs are filled with fluid, and oxygen is supplied through the umbilical cord. By 37 weeks, an infant's lungs are fully functional and ready make the change to breathing air outside the womb. A baby takes its first breath just moments after birth, when the lungs quickly start breathing air to supply the baby with oxygen and expel carbon dioxide."}
{"question": "when does the neural tube develops in a fetus", "answer": "Reasoning: The neural tube develops in a fetus. There is a specific time when the neural tube should develop. It would be harmful if the baby's neural tube does not develop properly. There may be actions that can be taken to ensure the development of the neural tube. There is a recommended time to start taking folate. There may be consequences if the neural tube does not develop properly.\nAnswer: About three weeks after egg fertilization, which is five weeks of pregnancy, the embryo elongates, and the neural tube begins to develop. The neural tube further develops into the brain and spinal cord, which continue to form and develop throughout pregnancy."}
{"question": "when do the first signs of tooth development begin", "answer": "Reasoning: Teeth start developing in the fetus. There is a process of tooth development in a baby. There are signs that indicate tooth development in a baby. There is a standard time for a baby's first teeth to come in. There is a way to tell if a baby's first teeth start to come in. If a baby's teeth do not develop at the standard time, it may be indicative of a health problem.\nAnswer: Babies are born with a full set of teeth below their gums. A wide range of variability exists of when a first tooth may appear, but they usually start coming in between the ages of 6 and 12 months. A first tooth usually breaks through the gum line when a baby is six months old. Typically, the first teeth to come in are the lower front teeth. Teething can cause pain and discomfort in babies; they may show signs of discomfort in the area where the tooth is coming in, and the gums around the erupting tooth may be red, swollen, and tender. The baby may drool more than usual. Other signs include fussiness, irritability, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, and biting or chewing on objects. Babies might also have a slight fever. The best way to soothe a teething baby is by gently rubbing the sore gums with a clean finger or moist, cool washcloth. Offer baby a clean, rubber teether to chew on. Avoid frozen teething rings as they are too hard for baby's mouth as well as numbing gels. Baby's pediatrician may recommend a dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve teething pain."}
{"question": "does babies hair fall out with cradle cap", "answer": "Reasoning: Cradle cap can cause hair loss. There is a treatment for cradle cap. Cradle cap usually develops at a certain age in babies. Cradle cap may not be a serious condition.\nAnswer: Cradle cap is a common condition in newborn babies. It causes thick white or yellow crusty scales on the scalp but can also affect the ears, eyelids, nose, and groin. The scaly patches may be dry and flaky or waxy and greasy, and they usually are not itchy. It usually does not cause hair loss. Cradle cap typically clears up on its own by six to 12 months of age. Home care measures include washing baby's scalp every other day with mild shampoo to help loosen and remove scales. Soften the skin of the scalp with baby oil. A baby brush or baby comb can also be used during baby's bath to help remove the scale in the hair. Never scratch or pick at cradle cap as this could cause an infection. If cradle cap doesn't clear up with home treatment, if the scaly patches become red, painful, or itchy, if the patches spread to baby's face or other areas of the body, or if baby's hair is falling out, see a health care professional."}
{"question": "what are the causes of post term pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: Post term pregnancy has a definition. There are potential dangers associated with post term pregnancy. There is a medical management for post term pregnancy. Post term pregnancy may be indicative of a health problem. There may be things that can be done to prevent post term pregnancy.\nAnswer: A pregnancy that lasts more than 42 weeks is called post-term. Healthcare providers do not know why some women carry a pregnancy longer than others, but it is often due to miscalculating the due date. Women are more likely to have a post-term pregnancy if they are pregnant with their first baby, had past previous post-term pregnancies, are overweight, or are having a boy. A number of possible complications exist for post-term pregnancies, such as longer labor, vaginal tearing, cesarean delivery, stillbirth and newborn death, placenta problems, decreased amniotic fluid, birth injury, and low blood sugar in the baby. To try to prevent any health problems for mother and baby during post-term pregnancies, healthcare providers may do maternal and fetal testing such as fetal movement counting, non-stress testing, and ultrasound. Heath care providers may induce labor to deliver the baby if tests find that it is not healthy for the developing baby to stay in the uterus."}
{"question": "when do baby start to open their eyes", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a standard time when babies should start to open their eyes. There may be a concern if a baby does not open their eyes immediately after birth. Babies do not open their eyes in the womb. There is a process of development for a baby's eyesight.\nAnswer: The fetus's eyelids fuse during week 10 of gestation and remain closed until about 26 weeks of gestation. At this stage, a baby's optic nerves and retina are formed, and the eyes start to open in the womb. A baby can see inside the uterus, and the eyes continue to develop through the end of pregnancy. A few minutes after birth, most infants open their eyes and start to look around. Newborns can see, but their eyes can't focus well at first. When holding your newborn, you can encourage eye opening by taking advantage of your baby's tendency to open its eyes when held in an upright position. If your baby is born premature and with closed eyelids, no special precautions or treatments are necessary. The lids will open on their own within a short time or by around 26 weeks."}
{"question": "where does the progesterone that helps maintain the pregnancy come from", "answer": "Reasoning: Progesterone helps maintain pregnancy. The corpus luteum is involved in the production of progesterone. Progesterone plays a role in both the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Progesterone may be produced by sources other than the corpus luteum.\nAnswer: The corpus luteum produces the hormone progesterone that makes the uterus a healthy environment for a developing fetus for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Then the placenta can start to produce enough progesterone to maintain the fetus for the remainder of the pregnancy. The corpus luteum is a normal group of cells that forms on the ovary every month in women of childbearing age. It appears right after ovulation when an egg is released from the ovary. If the egg gets fertilized, and an embryo implants in the uterus, then a placenta will also begin to develop. The placenta is the organ that holds the developing fetus and produces the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone to maintain the pregnancy. The corpus luteum will continue to produce progesterone for about 12 weeks, at which point the placenta can start to produce enough progesterone to maintain the fetus, and the corpus luteum then regresses and breaks down."}
{"question": "which of the following hormones is released by the corpus luteum after ovulation", "answer": "Reasoning: The corpus luteum releases hormones after ovulation. There are different hormones released by the corpus luteum at different times in a woman's cycle.\nAnswer: The corpus luteum primarily produces the hormone progesterone but also produces estrogen. Both hormones make the uterus a healthy environment for a developing fetus for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, after which the placenta can start to produce enough progesterone to maintain the fetus for the remainder of the pregnancy. The corpus luteum is a normal group of cells that forms on the ovary every month in women of childbearing age. It appears right after ovulation when an egg is released from the ovary. After it is done producing progesterone, it regresses and degrades."}
{"question": "when does the amniotic sac attached to the uterus", "answer": "Reasoning: The amniotic sac attaches to the uterus at a certain stage of embryo development. There is a specific number of days after fertilization when the embryo implants into the uterine wall. After the embryo attaches to the uterine wall, there may be certain events or changes that occur. There may be pills that can prevent pregnancy if taken before the amniotic sac attaches. If the amniotic sac has already attached, surgical abortion may be the only option to end the pregnancy.\nAnswer: The amniotic sac is not attached to the uterus, but rather it is the placenta that attaches to the uterus. In very early pregnancy, the fertilized egg implants into the wall of the uterus about six days after fertilization. The fertilized egg becomes a ball of cells called a blastocyst. The inner cells of the blastocyst develop into the embryo, and the outer cells burrow into the wall of the uterus and develop into the placenta. Some of the cells from the placenta develop into layers around the developing embryo. The outer layer of membranes forms the chorion, and the inner layer of cells forms the amnion, which becomes the amniotic sac. When the amniotic sac is completely formed around days 10-12, it fills with clear a liquid called amniotic fluid and expands to envelop the developing embryo. The embryo floats within the amniotic sac and continues to grow and develop under the lining of the uterus on one side. The fetus is connected to the placenta via the umbilical cord."}
{"question": "what is dilation of the cervical os prior to uterine contractions called", "answer": "Reasoning: The cervix dilates during labor. The cervix prepares for birth by dilating. Labor occurs through a process involving the cervix. There is a specific process by which the cervix dilates.\nAnswer: The cervix is a muscular, tunnel-like organ that is in the lower part of the uterus connecting the uterus and vagina. During childbirth, it widens to allow a baby to leave the uterus so the baby can travel through the vagina (birth canal). The cervix has an internal os and the external os. The internal os is the opening that leads to the uterus, and the external os is the opening that leads to the vagina. Near the end of pregnancy and in the beginning of labor, the cervix becomes softer and thinner, called effacement, and it widens, which is dilation. Dilation and effacement are caused by uterine contractions. The timing of cervical dilation is different for every woman. As you approach your due date, your cervix may start to dilate without any contractions. You may also lose the thick mucus plug that protects the cervix during pregnancy and have what is called a “bloody show.” When this occurs, it is an indication that the cervix is beginning to dilate prior to experiencing contractions. Dilation is a gradual process that can take weeks for some women, while others will dilate overnight."}
{"question": "what is the adequate amount of amniotic fluid", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a standard amount of amniotic fluid. Having less than or more than the standard amount of amniotic fluid may be dangerous for my baby. Amniotic fluid is important for my baby. There may be a way to increase the amount of amniotic fluid. There is a purpose for amniotic fluid. There may be a way to test for the amount of amniotic fluid. Testing for amniotic fluid may be dangerous for my baby.\nAnswer: Amniotic fluid is a clear, slightly yellow liquid that surrounds the unborn baby during pregnancy, contained in the amniotic sac. The baby floats in the amniotic fluid, and the fluid constantly circulates as the baby practices swallowing and breathing the fluid and urinates it out. The amniotic fluid contains nutrients, hormones, antibodies, and other fluids to keep the baby healthy and protected. Amniotic fluid helps with fetal growth and development, keeps the baby a constant temperature, prevents the umbilical cord from compression, and cushions the baby from injury. Health care providers measure amniotic fluid using ultrasound. The normal amount of fluid depends on how far along the pregnancy is. Levels increase throughout pregnancy and are the greatest at about 34 weeks of pregnancy when it averages 800 milliliters (mL). At full term, the amount of amniotic fluid averages about 600 mL. Too much amniotic fluid is called polyhydramnios and can occur with pregnancies of multiples, abnormalities of the baby, or gestational diabetes. Too little amniotic fluid is called oligohydramnios and can occur with late pregnancies, ruptured membranes, placental dysfunction, or fetal abnormalities. Health care providers may need to monitor pregnancies with abnormal amounts of amniotic fluid more carefully."}
{"question": "when did they start testing for group b strep in pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a condition called Group B strep (GBS). There is a test for GBS in pregnancy. Testing for GBS in pregnancy is important. There are formal screening guidelines for GBS. The guidelines for GBS testing were developed at a certain point in time.\nAnswer: Group B Streptococcus (group B strep) is a type of bacteria often found in the urinary tract, digestive system, and reproductive tracts. Most people who have it don't know that they do, and it usually doesn't cause health problems. Pregnant women can pass the infection to their babies during labor and delivery. Some babies can become very sick from group B strep infection. Pregnant women are routinely tested for group B strep late in pregnancy, usually between weeks 35 and 37. The test involves swabbing the vagina and rectum with a large cotton swab and culturing the samples in a laboratory. Treating women with group B strep with IV antibiotics during labor can prevent babies from developing early-onset group B strep disease."}
{"question": "when do the organs develop in a fetus", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a process of fetal development. Different organs develop at different times during fetal development. There is a specific time when the heart develops. There is a way to know if my baby's organs are developing correctly. There may be something that can be done if my baby's organs aren't developing correctly. It may be indicative of a health issue if my baby's organs don't develop in the standard time.\nAnswer: During pregnancy, the major structures of the body form in the first trimester, or before 14 weeks of gestation. The heart and major blood vessels begin to develop by about day 16 after egg fertilization. Most organs begin to form about five weeks of pregnancy, when the brain and spinal cord develop. Almost all organs are completely formed by about 12 weeks of pregnancy, which is the near the end of the first trimester. The exceptions are the brain and spinal cord, lungs, and heart, which continue to form and develop throughout pregnancy. During this period, the embryo is most vulnerable to the effects of drugs, radiation, and virus, and most birth defects occur during the period when organs are forming."}
{"question": "where does the gestation of the fetus occur", "answer": "Reasoning: Gestation is the process of development and growth of a fetus. Gestation typically occurs in the uterus. There are cases where gestation can occur in other anatomical locations, such as the fallopian tubes or outside of the uterus. It is possible to remove a fetus from the fallopian tube and place it in the uterus.\nAnswer: Gestation is the period of time between conception and birth when a baby grows and develops. It occurs inside the woman's uterus, also called the womb. A normal human gestation lasts between 37 to 42 weeks."}
{"question": "which drug when used alone is responsible for the most severe withdrawal symptoms in the newborn", "answer": "Reasoning: Different drugs can cause withdrawal symptoms in newborns. Multiple drugs used together can cause more severe withdrawal symptoms in newborns. Newborn withdrawal symptoms can be treated medically. There is a condition called neonatal abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms in newborns can occur at a certain time. Maternal opioid use can harm a newborn. There are medical treatments available for newborn withdrawal symptoms.\nAnswer: Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is a group of conditions caused when a baby withdraws from certain drugs he or she is exposed to in the womb. NAS occurs when a pregnant person takes drugs (legal or illegal) during pregnancy. At birth, the baby's dependence on the substance continues, causing symptoms of withdrawal and serious health problems for the baby. Most symptoms of NAS occur within three days after birth and can last anywhere from one week to six months. Symptoms may include body shakes, seizures, twitching, tight muscles, fussiness and excessive high-pitched crying, poor feeding and slow weight gain, breathing problems, fever, sweating, blotchy skin, trouble sleeping, diarrhea, vomiting, and stuffy nose or sneezing. The symptoms of NAS depend on the drug the mother used during pregnancy, how much of the drug used, how long the mother took the drug, how the mother's body breaks down the drug, and the baby's gestational age at birth. Some drugs are more likely to cause NAS than others, and specific drugs have been linked to specific problems in a baby. Opioids, such as heroin and methadone, cause serious withdrawal in about half of babies exposed prenatally, and symptoms can last as long as four to six months. A neonatal abstinence scoring system may be used to help diagnose and grade the severity of the withdrawal, which may help in planning treatment for the baby. Health care providers can also check meconium, urine, and umbilical cord blood to screen babies for drugs."}
{"question": "when fertilization and implantation occur what prevents the regression of the corpus luteum", "answer": "Reasoning: The corpus luteum is important in pregnancy. The regression of the corpus luteum may cause miscarriages. There may be a hormone or other substance/process that prevents the regression of the corpus luteum. There may be pills available to promote the health of the corpus luteum.\nAnswer: The corpus luteum is a normal group of cells that forms on the ovary every month in women of childbearing age. It appears right after ovulation when an egg is released from the ovary. It produces the hormone progesterone that makes the uterus a healthy environment for a developing fetus. If the egg gets fertilized, and implantation of an embryo occurs in the uterus, then a placenta will begin to develop. The placenta is the organ that holds the developing fetus and produces the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone to maintain the pregnancy. The corpus luteum will continue to produce progesterone for about 12 weeks, at which point the placenta can start to produce enough progesterone to maintain the fetus, and the corpus luteum gets smaller and starts to break down. If the egg does not get fertilized, the corpus luteum will start to break down and regress around 10 days after the egg leaves the follicle. Then the uterus will shed its lining during a menstrual period, and a new menstrual cycle begins."}
{"question": "when is low birth weight most commonly diagnosed", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a way to know if my baby is low birth weight. There is a test to determine if a baby is low birth weight. There may be ways to help my baby if they are low birth weight. Low birth weight may be harmful to my baby.\nAnswer: Birth weight is a baby's weight right after he or she is born. Within a few hours after birth, a healthcare provider will weigh the baby and compare the baby's birth weight with the gestational age (how far along the mother was in pregnancy). A baby is diagnosed as low birth weight when he or she weighs less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces (2,500 grams) at birth or very low birth weight when he or she weighs less than 3 pounds, 5 ounces (1,500 grams) at birth. Low birth weight is common in the United States, affecting about one in every 12 babies (about 8.52% of all live births). Before a baby is born, a healthcare provider can estimate the size of your baby in different ways during prenatal exams to check if your baby might be born with low birth weight. One way to track fetal growth is by monitoring the mother's weight gain and measuring fundal height, which is the distance from the top of the mother's uterus to her pubic bone. Ultrasounds can also track fetal growth and development."}
{"question": "where does the term baby blues come from", "answer": "Reasoning: Baby blues is a term used to describe a certain condition or experience. There may be ways to help oneself if experiencing baby blues. There are signs that can help identify if someone has baby blues. Baby blues is a common experience. Getting rid of baby blues is desirable. Baby blues may be indicative of a mental health issue. Baby blues may be preventable. Baby blues may be treatable.\nAnswer: The “baby blues” are the least severe form of postpartum depression. The term “baby blues” refers to the feelings of sadness new mothers commonly feel after the birth of their baby. Approximately 70-80% of all new mothers experience some symptoms of the “baby blues.” Symptoms include mood swings, weepiness or crying for no apparent reason, impatience, irritability, restlessness, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, sadness, mood changes, and poor concentration. Often symptoms are noticeable within four to five days after birth. The cause is thought to be related to hormone changes that occur after a baby is born, producing chemical changes in the brain that result in depression. Also, the large adjustment that comes after the birth of a baby, along with sleep disturbance, disruption of routine, and emotions from childbirth can all contribute to how a new mom feels."}
{"question": "what causes high sodium levels in newborn babies", "answer": "Reasoning: There are signs that indicate high sodium levels in babies. There may be something that can be done to help a baby with high sodium levels. High sodium levels can be harmful to a baby. There is a way to detect high levels of sodium in a baby. The signs of high sodium levels may be different for adults and babies.\nAnswer: Neonatal hypernatremia, or high blood serum sodium, is a serious condition in newborn babies usually caused by dehydration. Infants who are breastfeeding may develop the condition with insufficient feeding, and it may occur more often in infants with very low birth weight. Symptoms include significant weight loss, lethargy, and seizures. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring blood serum sodium concentrations that are greater than 150mEq/L (150mmol/L). Neonatal hypernatremia is potentially lethal and associated with a number of serious health conditions in babies, including brain swelling, brain bleeding, kidney failure, and infection, and can lead to death if not treated. Treatment involves cautious hydration over two to three days with an IV saline solution to decrease blood sodium levels. Monitoring mother and baby in the first weeks of life for successful establishment of breastfeeding is essential to preventing hypernatremia. In an otherwise healthy baby, poor feeding and weight loss could be a reason to suspect hypernatremia."}
{"question": "where does the fertilization of the ovum take place in a normal pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: Fertilization of the ovum occurs in a specific location in a normal pregnancy. There is a process called fertilization. Conception is a process that occurs in pregnancy. Fertilization of the ovum can occur in different locations.\nAnswer: During each menstrual cycle, one egg, or ovum, is usually released from one of the ovaries. The egg gets swept into the fallopian tubes, and within minutes, sperm may move into the funnel-shaped end of the fallopian tube and fertilize the egg. The cells lining the fallopian tube facilitate fertilization."}
{"question": "what causes sudden infant death syndrome also called sids", "answer": "Reasoning: SIDS has a cause. SIDS is deadly to babies. There are ways to prevent SIDS in babies. There is a recommended sleep position for babies. Sleeping on the back is recommended for babies. Sleeping on the stomach may not be safe for babies. Using crib bumpers may not be safe for babies. SIDS usually occurs at certain ages. There may be ways to recognize SIDS. There may be ways to prevent SIDS.\nAnswer: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death of a baby. The baby is usually less than one year old and seems to be healthy. The death often occurs during sleep. The cause of SIDS is unknown, but it may be caused by problems in the area of an infant's brain that controls breathing and waking up from sleep. Research has also found that babies who died from SIDS had high levels of serotonin in their blood, which could suggest a problem with how the body uses serotonin. Research has found some factors that put babies at higher risk of SIDS. Physical factors include defects in the area of the brain that controls breathing and waking up from sleep, low birth weight, and respiratory infections that lead to breathing problems. Sleep factors include sleeping on the stomach or side, sleeping on a soft surface, sharing a bed with parents or siblings, and overheating while sleeping. While there is no definite way to prevent SIDS, you can help your baby sleep more safely. Have baby sleep in your room with you, in a crib or bassinet, for at least the first six months. Use a firm, flat mattress, and keep the crib as bare as possible. Put baby to sleep on his or her back. Keep your baby warm with a sleep sack instead of blankets and avoid overheating. Offer a pacifier for baby to suck on at nap time or bedtime. Breastfeeding your baby for at least six months has also been shown to lower the risk of SIDS."}
{"question": "when is the cardiovascular system functioning in a fetus", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a specific time during fetal development when the cardiovascular system develops. There is a way to know if my baby's heart is developing correctly. There may be something that can be done if my baby's cardiovascular system is not developing correctly. There is a point in pregnancy when a fetal heartbeat can be heard. It may be indicative of a health issue if my baby's cardiovascular system does not develop within the standard time.\nAnswer: Cardiovascular development in an embryo occurs between three and six weeks after ovulation. The heart and major blood vessels begin to develop in an embryo around 16 days after fertilization. The heart begins to pump fluid through blood vessels by day 20. Thus, by the end of the fourth week of gestation, the heartbeats of a fetus begin."}
{"question": "when does fetal erythrocyte production shift from the liver to the bone marrow", "answer": "Reasoning: Fetal erythrocyte production starts in the liver and shifts to the bone marrow. Red blood cells develop in a baby's body. Red blood cells develop in different locations in fetuses and adults.\nAnswer: Red blood cell (erythrocyte) production is called erythropoiesis. Red blood cells transport oxygen throughout the body. Red blood cell production starts when the fetus is in the womb, and the location changes as a fetus develops. During week three, erythropoiesis begins in the yolk sac. By months two and three, it occurs in the liver and spleen. By month five, production has shifted to the bone marrow, where it remains through adulthood."}
{"question": "when is rh immune globulin given during pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: Rh immune globulin is given during pregnancy for a specific reason. There may be a requirement or recommendation for taking rh immune globulin during pregnancy. There may be potential health issues if rh immune globulin is not taken. There may be some risks associated with taking rh immune globulin.\nAnswer: The Rh factor is a protein that can be found on the surface of red blood cells. If your blood cells have this protein, you are Rh positive, and if your blood cells do not have this protein, you are Rh negative. During pregnancy, problems can occur if the mother is Rh negative and the fetus is Rh positive. This condition is called Rh incompatibility. The mother's body will make anti-Rh antibodies, which can cross the placenta and attack the fetus's blood cells. This can lead to serious health problems, such as severe anemia and even death, for a fetus or a newborn. Treatment can be given to prevent these problems in the form of Rh immunoglobulin (RhIg). It is a medication often given at 28 weeks of pregnancy that stops the body from making Rh antibodies if it has not already made them. RhIg can also be given within 72 hours after the delivery of an Rh-positive baby. A dose of RhIg may also be given in situations where maternal and fetal blood can mix during pregnancy, such as after amniocentesis or fetal surgery, if you had bleeding during pregnancy, if you had trauma to the abdomen during pregnancy, or if attempts were made to manually turn a fetus from a breech presentation. RhIg treatment does not help if an Rh-negative woman has already made antibodies."}
{"question": "where did the name cesarean section come from", "answer": "Reasoning: Cesarean sections were named after someone. The first cesarean section was performed at some point in history. C-section stands for something. There is a potential connection between cesarean sections and Julius Caesar.\nAnswer: It is not known for certain where or when the term cesarean was derived. Early history of the word cesarean has been distorted over time. It is commonly believed to be derived from the surgical birth of Julius Caesar; however, this seems unlikely since his mother is said to have lived to hear of her son's invasion of Britain. At that time a cesarean section was performed only when the mother was dead or dying as an attempt to save the child. Roman law under Caesar decreed all women must be cut open to birth a child. Other possible Latin origins include the verb “caedare,” meaning to cut, and the term “caesones” that was applied to infants born by postmortem operations. It was not until the nineteenth century that the possibility of preserving the mother's life during the procedure came within grasp of the medical profession."}
{"question": "when can fetal heartbeat be detected with doppler", "answer": "Reasoning: A fetus' heart starts beating at a certain point in pregnancy. A doppler can detect a fetal heartbeat. There is a recommended time to have the first ultrasound. There may be some risks associated with doppler exams for the baby. If a fetal heartbeat cannot be detected by doppler, it may indicate a problem.\nAnswer: A fetal Doppler monitor, or acoustic Doppler, is a hand-held ultrasound transducer that is used to monitor a baby's heart rate in the womb. A fetal Doppler can allow you to hear your baby's heartbeat and measure how the heart rate changes when your baby moves. By monitoring your baby's heart rate, your healthcare provider can tell if the heart rate is too high or too low or changing too much. The heartbeat is difficult to detect in the first trimester because the baby is so small. While a fetal heartbeat can be detected as early as 8 weeks when using a transvaginal Doppler ultrasound, an acoustic Doppler is not as sensitive. It is also not recommended to use fetal acoustic Doppler ultrasound during the first trimester due to safety risks to the fetus. Many healthcare providers begin to routinely use the acoustic fetal Doppler to listen to the baby's heartbeat at 12 weeks."}
{"question": "how long does crack stay in a fetus system", "answer": "Reasoning: Crack can pass through the placenta. Crack can harm a baby. Different drugs enter the fetal system in different ways. Different drugs remain in the fetal system for different lengths of time.\nAnswer: When a pregnant woman uses cocaine, it can be very harmful to her and her unborn baby. Fetal exposure to cocaine is associated with several severe risks, including premature birth, health issues, developmental delays and disabilities, and cognitive and intellectual problems. Some effects of drug use during pregnancy can persist for long after the baby is born. The extent of the negative consequences depends on dosage, timing, and duration of a mother's drug use, which influence how long the baby was exposed to the drug. A method for detecting cocaine exposure involves testing a newborn's meconium, or the first stool. Meconium formation in the fetal intestines begins around the 12th week of pregnancy and continues to build up until birth. As a result, meconium testing can detect if a fetus was exposed to cocaine as early as the second trimester. The quantity and frequency of a mother's cocaine usage during pregnancy have the biggest impact on how long it stays detectable in meconium."}
{"question": "what does it mean to sleep train a baby", "answer": "Reasoning: Sleep training is a process that can be done to help a baby sleep better. There is a specific way to sleep train a baby. Sleep training may only be effective at certain ages. Sleep training may take a certain amount of time to see results.\nAnswer: Sleep training is the process of babies learning to fall asleep independently, without needing a caregiver to rock or soothe. It involves getting babies to realize that they can put themselves to sleep or self-soothe. This can occur in the very beginning of the night or when they wake up in the middle of the night. Sleep training leads to more sleep for parents and caregivers and also improves an infant's sleep quality. It is recommended that sleep training begin when baby is about four months old when babies are old enough to learn to self soothe and no longer require night feedings. One of the most famously known techniques is the cry it out method, but many other methods exist. Techniques often overlap, and methods can be combined to find out what works best for the parent and the baby. Sometimes it might take some trial and error to figure out a method with which both parent and baby are comfortable. Sleep training takes practice and patience. To be successful, parents should have a plan and be consistent."}
{"question": "when does the amniotic sac develop and when does it break", "answer": "Reasoning: The amniotic sac develops at a certain point in pregnancy. The amniotic sac has a function during pregnancy. The amniotic sac has a role during labor. There may be risks associated with the amniotic sac rupturing too early. Rupturing of the amniotic sac is an important part of birth.\nAnswer: During pregnancy, your baby is surrounded and cushioned by a fluid-filled membranous sac called the amniotic sac. The amniotic sac is completely formed very early in pregnancy, around 10-12 days after fertilization. It fills with clear a liquid called amniotic fluid and expands to envelop the developing embryo. The embryo floats within the amniotic sac and continues to grow and develop under the lining of the uterus. When the membranes of the amniotic sac rupture, amniotic fluid comes out of the vagina, and this is known as your “water breaking.” It is a sign that the baby will be delivered soon. In most cases, the membranes rupture during labor or within 24 hours before the start of labor. Your water might break right before delivery, or your health care provider may even break your water for you. Premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) occurs when the membranes break before the 37th week of pregnancy. The earlier in pregnancy that your water breaks, the greater the safety risk for mother and baby. If your water breaks early, your health care provider will advise you on the safest thing to do for you and your baby."}
{"question": "when does a zygote turn into an embryo", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a process called gestation. There is a stage called fertilization. Embryos go through different developmental stages.\nAnswer: A zygote is formed when a sperm fertilizes an egg. The zygote contains all of the genetic information needed to become a baby. The zygote travels down the fallopian tube while dividing into a ball of cells called a blastocyst. When the blastocyst reaches the uterus, about one week after fertilization, it buries itself into the uterine wall. This process, called implantation, is usually competed by day 10. Then cells of the blastocyst develop into the embryo, the placenta, and the amniotic sac. By the third week after fertilization (week 5 of pregnancy), the embryonic period of development begins."}
{"question": "what is a typical one minute apgar score for a newborn", "answer": "Reasoning: Apgar scores are measured at different times after birth. Apgar scores are important measures of a newborn's health. There are standard apgar scores. If a newborn has an apgar score below the standard, it may indicate a health issue.\nAnswer: The Apgar score is a rapid method of assessing the physical condition of a newborn infant after delivery to see if extra medical care or emergency care is needed. The Apgar score comprises five components: 1) color, 2) heart rate, 3) reflexes, 4) muscle tone, and 5) respiration. Each component is given a score of 0, 1, or 2, which are added to get a total score. Scores are between 10 and 0. The total score is reported at one minute and five minutes after birth for all infants. A baby who scores 7 or above on the test is considered in good health. A lower score means that a baby may need some immediate medical care such as suctioning the airways or oxygen to help the baby breathe better. Many babies with low scores are healthy after adjusting to life outside the womb."}
{"question": "how long can a woman have breast milk", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be actions that can be taken to prolong the time a woman can breastfeed. There is a reason why breast milk stops being secreted. There may be a recommended duration for breastfeeding a baby. Increasing milk production time is desirable. Breast milk production may be affected by a woman's actions.\nAnswer: Maintaining lactation, or the process of producing breast milk, is a supply-and-demand process. The more a baby breastfeeds or the more milk that is expressed with a breast pump, the more a mother's body will make. That means a woman will continue to make breast milk as long as her baby is breastfeeding or she continues to pump breast milk. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby's life with continued breastfeeding for up to two years of age or older. Most experts agree that breastfeeding should continue for as long as it suits mother and baby. Many women stop producing breast milk when they choose to wean their baby or when their child naturally weans as he or she grows older and relies less on breast milk. Weaning usually occurs with the introduction of solid foods and cow's milk after the age of one. A woman's milk supply will gradually decline as she reduces the number of times she breastfeeds or pumps until she eventually stops producing breast milk."}
{"question": "How much iron do I need in pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: Iron is required during pregnancy. There is a recommended daily intake of iron during pregnancy. The recommended iron intake changes throughout the different trimesters of pregnancy. Iron requirements may vary based on health factors. There are health concerns associated with not receiving enough iron during pregnancy. Iron supplementation may be necessary during pregnancy. There may be risks associated with taking iron supplements during pregnancy. There may be a risk of developing preeclampsia if not enough iron is consumed.\nAnswer: Pregnant women are especially vulnerable to be iron deficient, or have low iron. Their rapidly expanding blood volume, developing baby, and placenta all require increased iron. The World Health Organization recommends 40-60mg per day, with women who are already anemic or have other risk factors on the higher end. Infants born to anemic mothers have up to have the iron reserves as infants born to mothers with normal levels of red blood cells. Iron supplements often contain vitamin C to help your body absorb it, and likewise eating a diet rich in vitamin C (lots of citrus fruits and fresh raw vegetables) can help you better absorb the iron you may be already eating."}
{"question": "When is it safe to give my baby real food?", "answer": "Reasoning: I should wait until my baby shows signs of readiness before introducing solid foods. There is a specific age at which it is safe to start introducing solid foods. There are certain nutritional requirements that should be considered before introducing solid foods. There are recommended guidelines for introducing solid foods into my baby's diet. There is a milestone that indicates when it is appropriate to start feeding my baby solid food. The introduction of solid foods complements breastmilk or formula. Giving my baby other food too early may be dangerous. Starting solid foods earlier may not necessarily help my baby sleep through the night. My baby's nutritional needs change as they grow and develop. My baby may become more satisfied with solid foods and less interested in breast milk or formula.\nAnswer: Formula or breastmilk only is recommended up to six months of age, but after consulting with your pediatrician your baby may be ready for you to introduce solid foods at or after six months. Some signs they may be developmentally ready include good head and neck control, showing an interest in food, and not immediately spitting food out. The American Academy of Pediatrics says that you don't have to introduce foods in a certain order, but should avoid artificially sweetened foods, choking hazards, and don't offer honey, cow's milk, or fruit juice before 12 months of age."}
{"question": "Why is my pelvis sore?", "answer": "Reasoning: Pelvic soreness is a normal part of pregnancy. There may be a point at which pelvic pain during pregnancy becomes a cause for concern. There are physiological changes that occur in the pelvis during pregnancy. Pregnancy hormones, like relaxin, can contribute to pelvic discomfort. The pelvic structures undergo changes as the uterus grows. The position of the baby in the womb may contribute to variations in pelvic pain intensity.\nAnswer: Your symphysis pubis, or the joint made of cartilage right in the middle of the front of your pelvis, can become a source of great discomfort during pregnancy. This can also be referred to as symphysis pubis dysfunction. Additional weight gain, gait changes, and the hormones relaxing the ligaments that hold your pelvis in place are all normal parts of pregnancy that can contribute to this pain. It can be normal for the front, back, or both areas of your pelvis to be uncomfortable and for it to feel loose. Using ice, staying active, stretching, taking breaks from sitting, and sleeping with a pillow between your knees are a few things you can do to relief the discomfort."}
{"question": "When can my child stop using a booster seat?", "answer": "Reasoning: Children eventually no longer need a booster seat. There is a recommended age to transition a child out of a booster seat. There are age milestones for using a booster seat. There are legal requirements for transitioning a child out of a booster seat. There are height and weight thresholds that a child should reach before transitioning out of a booster seat. There is a way to assess if a child is physically and behaviorally mature enough to no longer need a booster seat. Booster seats are not only for very young children, and older children may still need one. If a child complains about using a booster seat, it does not necessarily mean they are old enough to stop using it. A child cannot transition directly to using a regular seatbelt once they outgrow their car seat. Just because a child is older than their friends who have stopped using booster seats, it does not mean they can also stop using one.\nAnswer: There are several requirements your child must meet before it's  safe for them to ride in the car without a booster seat. They need to meet a height requirement, generally 4 feet 9 inches, so that the shoulder strap fits snugly across their shoulder and chest, not their neck. Additionally, the lap belt must be on their upper thighs, not their stomach. Most children don't safely fit in adult seat belts until 10 to 12 years old. All children younger than 13 should ride only in the backseat of the car."}
{"question": "What is the maximum weight I can carry while pregnant?", "answer": "Reasoning: It is safe to carry things while pregnant up to a certain weight. The amount of weight I carry can affect my pregnancy. I may not be able to lift the same amount of weight I did before I was pregnant without any concerns. It may be beneficial to avoid lifting anything heavy during pregnancy to be on the safe side. Lifting heavy objects can potentially cause a miscarriage or harm the baby. There may be different weight limits for lifting and carrying during each trimester of pregnancy. There may be different recommendations for exercise and weightlifting routines during pregnancy. There may be recommended techniques for lifting and carrying to reduce the risk of injury during pregnancy. There may be health implications of lifting heavy weight while pregnant.\nAnswer: Moderate exercise in pregnancy with your doctor's approval can promote a healthy pregnancy. Your doctor's specific recommendations for you may have a lot to do with your physical fitness baseline prior to pregnancy. Pregnant women can be more at risk for a musculoskeletal injury due to the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy and a change in weight distribution that may affect balance. It's important to check with your provider to see what may be appropriate for you. Pay attention to your balance, any pain, and shortness of breath to decide when you need to slow down, take a break, or stop an activity."}
{"question": "When can my baby face front in a car?", "answer": "Reasoning: It is considered safe for a baby to face forward in their car seat at a certain age. There may be specific weight and height requirements for turning the baby's car seat to face forward. Car seat manufacturers provide guidelines regarding when a baby can face forward. There may be developmental milestones to consider before turning a baby's car seat to face forward. There may be potential risks associated with turning a baby's car seat to face forward too early. The type of vehicle may influence when a baby's car seat can be faced forward. Turning the baby forward-facing is a milestone in their development. Car seats are supposed to change as the baby grows. The baby may enjoy the car ride more if they can see the front. All babies should face forward after a certain age. It may be safer for the baby to face forward once they can sit up on their own. Once the baby outgrows their infant car seat, they should face forward.\nAnswer: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommends to keep your child rear facing as long as possible. Your child is able to stay in their rear facing car seat until they reach the top weight or height limit allowed by the seat manufacturer.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest keeping your child rear facing from birth until age 2-4. This is the safest positioning offering the best possible protection in case of an accident."}
{"question": "How long before my breast milk supply comes in?", "answer": "Reasoning: Colostrum production typically begins during pregnancy. There are factors that contribute to the start of milk production. Milk production begins at a specific stage of pregnancy. The onset of milk production may vary based on certain health statuses of mothers. There may be certain foods and/or medications that can influence the onset of milk production. Breast milk does not necessarily come in immediately after giving birth. Feeling full does not necessarily mean that milk has come in. Breast size does not determine milk production capacity. Not leaking milk does not mean that milk supply is low. Supplementing with formula may not be necessary until milk comes in.\nAnswer: Often times moms think that the yellow, thick liquid before birth and within the first few days is breastmilk. This is actually colostrum or \"liquid gold.\" It is a thick, rich milk that's high in nutrients and antibodies. Between 2-5 days after giving birth, many women notice engorgement or swelling of the breasts. They will feel much fuller and the volume will dramatically increase. It is perfectly normal to only be able to pump or hand express very small amounts (sometimes a few drops only) within the first few days. It's important to keep breastfeeding or stimulating the breasts with a pump to ensure your body knows to make more milk in the coming days."}
{"question": "What is a good way for my child to express feelings?", "answer": "Reasoning: Children should express their feelings openly and directly. There is a 'right' or 'normal' way for a child to express feelings. Expressing feelings is not limited to verbal communication. Children should not suppress their emotions. Expressing anger may be considered unhealthy or inappropriate. Emotional expression is a learned behavior. There are activities or games that can help a child appropriately express their emotions. There are age-appropriate books or stories that can help a child understand and express their emotions healthily. There may be certain signals or cues that indicate a child may be struggling to express their emotions. There are activities or exercises that promote emotional intelligence in children and encourage them to identify and share their feelings. There are ways to help a child differentiate between various emotions and label them accurately.\nAnswer: Teaching children about different emotions can start by making a face and having them guess what you're feeling. Sharing your own emotions, like, \"Today I lost my keys and that made me frustrated,\" can help set the example for them to express what they are feeling. You can also point out emotions on others' faces, for example, \"Look at your friend Sally's face! She is so happy you came to play with her. Talking about feelings provides emotional relief, and helping kids use specific words to describe their feelings has been shown by research to be helpful."}
{"question": "What is the schedule for my baby to see a doctor?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a recommended schedule for well-child or well-baby checkups for babies. There is a recommended timeline for the first doctor's visit after a baby is born. Regular doctor visits are important for assessing a baby's developmental progress. There may be specific health concerns or issues that require more frequent doctor visits for a baby. All doctor visits for babies are not solely focused on vaccinations, but also on overall health monitoring. The schedule for doctor visits may vary depending on the healthcare provider's individual approach to pediatric care.\nAnswer: The first year of routine doctor appointments are often called \"Well Baby Appointments\". These appointments are when baby has been discharged from the hospital at 2-3 days, 1 month, 4 months, 6 months, and 9 months. Your provider will go over developmental milestones, recommend vitamins and supplements, monitor your baby's growth charts, and give advice on recommended vaccinations. It's important to keep your child's medical documents organized, keep a list of questions to ask at their appointments, know what vaccines they have received, and ask for advice on what to do if your baby is sick."}
{"question": "What do Braxton hicks contractions feel like?", "answer": "Reasoning: Braxton Hicks contractions are not necessarily painful. Braxton Hicks contractions can occur at any stage of pregnancy. The physical sensation of Braxton Hicks contractions can vary. Braxton Hicks contractions can occur with different frequencies. There are symptoms associated with Braxton Hicks contractions. There is a difference between Braxton Hicks contractions and actual labor contractions.\nAnswer: When a woman reaches the second or third trimester, she may experience Braxton Hicks contractions. These contractions are thought to be the body's way of preparing the uterine muscles for true labor. Real labor contractions get progressively stronger and aren't affected by changes in position or activity. Braxton Hicks contractions typically are mild and may get weaker over time and often if the woman changes position they will go away. If your provider is unsure what type of contractions you are having, they can monitor you for cervical change. They may check your cervix a few hours apart to see if there is any change. If there is not, they may be Braxton Hicks contractions."}
{"question": "Does the placenta grow bigger as time goes on?", "answer": "Reasoning: The size of the placenta changes throughout pregnancy. There are factors that influence the growth of the placenta during pregnancy. There is a typical pattern or rate of placental growth in each trimester. The growth of the placenta correlates to the growth of the baby in utero. The size of the placenta relates to the overall health of the pregnancy. The placenta changes in structure and function throughout pregnancy. The growth of the placenta is monitored during routine prenatal care.\nAnswer: provides the baby with nutrients and oxygen, and removes toxins from the baby's blood. Your placenta grows along with your baby and your uterus during your pregnancy. Placentas under the 10th percentile can be dangerous for pregnancy and cause stillbirth or a small for gestational age baby. Having an excessively large placenta can happen to moms that have gestational diabetes."}
{"question": "How many shots does an infant get ?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a recommended number of vaccines for infants. There is a recommended vaccination schedule for infants. There may be specific vaccinations that infants receive at different ages. Vaccination recommendations may not be the same for all infants. Infants are supposed to receive multiple vaccines. Vaccines are an important preventative measure to keep my baby healthy. Infants receive shots for serious diseases. Too many shots at once can overwhelm an infant's immune system. Infants may not be able to handle the pain from shots.\nAnswer: Within their first year of life, most doctors recommend your baby get six series of shots. The first vaccines usually occur when your baby is in the hospital after birth, then at the 2 month appointment, 4 month, 6 month, 9 month, and 12 month. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has a published vaccine schedule that lists each vaccine and at what age your child should get it. Some vaccines have to be given in a series, meaning your child has to get several iterations of the vaccine to gain immunity."}
{"question": "How can I prevent my baby peeing through diaper?", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be specific diaper brands that offer better leakage protection. It may be necessary to change my baby's diaper more frequently to prevent leaks. My baby's clothing may be a factor in diaper leaks. My baby's gender may be a factor in diaper leakage. There may be gender-specific tips to prevent diaper leaks. My baby's diet may be contributing to increased urine and diaper leaks. Diaper leaks can be a sign that the diaper is not absorbent enough.\nAnswer: When changing your baby's diaper, it's important to have a good fit and wash your hands before and after. You should check and or change your baby's diaper at least every time you feed them and whenever your child indicates discomfort. It's important to make sure the diaper fits your baby well around their abdomen and legs with no gaps. Ensure the ruffles on around the legs are pulled out to keep a good seal. Sometimes it can help overnight to go up a diaper size or use overnight diapers."}
{"question": "How do you know when your baby is full?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are signals or cues that a baby will make when they are full. The overall body language of a baby may change before, during, and after feeding. A baby may show signs of disinterest or distraction during feeding when they are full. Babies typically have a certain frequency and duration of feeding. Recognizing when a baby is full is a learned skill for parents.\nAnswer: When feeding newborns, it's important to pay attention to their feeding cues. They may chew on their hands, turn their head side to side, open their mouth, and lick their lips to tell you they want to eat. Crying is a later sign of hunger. After they are full, you may notice them spitting up, unlatching from the breast or bottle, and appearing very relaxed. Hungry newborns typically have tightly fisted hands, and you may notice by the end of the feeding their hands are open and relaxed."}
{"question": "What are the stages in an infants life?", "answer": "Reasoning: Infants go through key developmental milestones. There are growth patterns in the first few months of life. There is a standard physical and cognitive development pattern that infants follow. There are signs of readiness for various developmental milestones.\nAnswer: The skills or \"firsts\" your baby has like smiling, rolling over, talking, and walking are referred to as developmental milestones. Each baby develops a little differently, and your provider will check in at your 2, 4, 6, and 9 month Well Baby Appointments about these milestones. In their first year, babies are growing rapidly physically, mentally, and emotionally. They are developing bonds, love and affection, and a sense of self."}
{"question": "How do you know if the baby is sunny side up?", "answer": "Reasoning: \"Sunny side up\" is a term used to describe a specific position of the baby during childbirth. The optimal position for a baby during childbirth may not be \"sunny side up.\" The position of the baby during labor can be determined by a healthcare provider. There may be risks or complications associated with a baby being \"sunny side up\" during childbirth. The position of the baby can potentially be assessed during prenatal visits.\nAnswer: The term \"sunny side up\" is referencing the most common malpresentation of babies at birth, which is known scientifically as occiput posterior positioning. That means that the back of the baby's head is to the back of mom's pelvis, and when they are born this way they will come out facing up instead of down. Babies born this way may require an assisted delivery, and in some cases an emergency cesarean section. It's important to keep repositioning during the labor process to encourage the baby to descend into the pelvis in a favorable position."}
{"question": "What kind of instrument is good for my baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: Learning a musical instrument at a young age may enhance cognitive development in children. There are instruments that are considered safe for babies. There are age-appropriate guidelines for introducing musical instruments to a baby. Different instruments can contribute to a baby's development in different ways. There are instruments designed specifically for certain age groups of babies. There are instruments that are suitable for infants and others that are suitable for toddlers. Introducing my baby to music early may foster a lifelong love for and appreciation of music. Playing a musical instrument can have positive effects on a child's well-being.\nAnswer: Music is important developmentally for kids, and studies have shown their brains look different after listening to music. Music can make you and your baby smarter and happier. Listening to and playing music release endorphins, the hormones that make you feel happy. Using any kind of hand held musical instrument helps babies develop fine motor skills, and as they get older, making a song or keeping a beat require multiple different areas of the brain at once."}
{"question": "How do I know when I lose mucus plug ?", "answer": "Reasoning: The mucus plug is lost at some point during pregnancy or childbirth. The loss of the mucus plug is a significant milestone during pregnancy. There is a specific time during pregnancy when the mucus plug will most likely be lost. There are common signs and symptoms accompanying the loss of the mucus plug. There is a way to identify the loss of the mucus plug. There will be a sign or symptom that is noticeable when the mucus plug is lost. The loss of the mucus plug can occur without any noticeable symptoms. There may be circumstances where the loss of the mucus plug should be a cause for concern. There may be a difference in the loss of the mucus plug during a first pregnancy versus subsequent pregnancies.\nAnswer: The mucus plug is a jelly, stringy like material that is a layer of protection to keep bacteria out of your uterus while you are pregnant. Some people lose their mucus plug as they reach the end of pregnancy. Although it may indicate that your body is preparing for labor, labor could still be weeks away. This is not a cause for concern or an indication that labor is imminent. If this happens to you and you are concerned, you may always call your provider for guidance specific to your pregnancy and medical history."}
{"question": "When can I start giving my baby food?", "answer": "Reasoning: My baby's nutritional needs change as they develop. At some point my baby will start to transition from breastmilk or formula to other foods. I will change what my baby eats at a certain stage in their development. My baby will transition to solid foods at a specific age. There are signs or behaviors that indicate my baby is ready to start eating solid foods. There are recommended signs that indicate my baby is ready for solid foods. There is a specific age at which I can start introducing solid foods to my baby. There is a recommended feeding schedule when introducing solid foods to my baby. There are specific solid foods that should be introduced to my baby first. There is a way to balance breastfeeding or formula feeding with the introduction of solid foods.\nAnswer: Most experts recommend that babies are ready for foods around six months of age. Since all babies develop a little differently, it's important to consult your baby's doctor before making changes to their diet. Some indications your baby may be ready for food are good head and neck control, showing interest in food, and not immediately spitting food out. Once you introduce new foods to your baby, it's important to wait 3-5 days before introducing another so if any type of reaction occurs you are able to correlate what food may have caused it."}
{"question": "How often do babies feet grow?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies' feet start to experience noticeable growth at a certain age. There is a general pattern or timeframe for how often a baby's feet will grow during the first year. Factors like genetics may influence how fast a baby's feet will grow. There may be noticeable signs or behaviors in a baby that indicate their feet are going through a growth phase. There may be specific measurements or benchmarks parents can use to track their baby's foot growth. Babies' feet grow regularly over time. Babies' feet grow at a different rate than other age groups. Parents will need to change their baby's socks and shoes often based on their feet growth.\nAnswer: Research has shown that in the first 3 years of life, your child's feet will probably grow about three quarters of an inch every year. Up until age 4, research shows that your child may need a new size of shoe every four months. It's also important to know that each child is on their own growth curve, and your child could deviate from this general guidelines. It can be beneficial for your child to be barefoot while indoors when they are learning to walk, but is also important to have good fitting shoes to protect their feet when they are walking outside."}
{"question": "How do you know if you're having contractions?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a way to know if you are having contractions. Contractions are different from regular pregnancy discomfort. Contractions can start gradually or suddenly. There may be signs or symptoms accompanying contractions. The pain of a contraction may be different from other types of pain. There may be variations in the intensity of contractions. Contractions may feel different during early labor compared to active labor.\nAnswer: As you enter the second and third trimester, it's very common to have some mild contractions as your body prepares to give birth. Some women don't even notice these. As you go into labor, contractions get stronger and closer together. They will become so intense that generally you can't walk or talk when you're having them. Sometimes irregular contractions can happen if you are not drinking enough water or if you have been on your feet doing a lot of activities. If you are having mild contractions, your nurse or provider may advise you stay very well hydrated and take a break to see if the contractions stop or slow down."}
{"question": "Can I give my 6 month old food?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a recommended age to start introducing solid foods to a baby. There are signs that can indicate if a baby is ready for solid food. There are specific types of foods that are appropriate for a 6-month-old baby. There may be certain solid foods that should be avoided when introducing them to a 6-month-old. There is a recommended amount of solid food to offer a 6-month-old during feeding. There are specific nutritional requirements for a 6-month-old.\nAnswer: Generally, around six months of age most babies are developmentally ready to start trying solid foods. Transitioning to solid foods takes time, and your baby is using their mouth, lips, and tongue in totally new ways. You should consult your child's pediatrician about making dietary changes and to see if they feel your baby is ready at six months. Some signs babies are ready for food besides breastmilk or formula are good head and neck control, showing interest in foods others are eating, and not spitting food out of their mouth immediately."}
{"question": "Is it okay for babies to be in swimming clases?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies can start swimming classes at a certain age. There are potential benefits to enrolling a baby in swimming classes. There may be some risks associated with introducing a baby to swimming at an early age. Swimming classes can contribute to a baby's physical development. There are safety measures in place during baby swimming classes. Babies are at risk of drowning. Swim lessons for babies may not be safe. My baby can learn to swim. Babies may be scared or uncomfortable in water.\nAnswer: One of the most important skills your baby will gain in their first few years is motor development. Studies have shown that there may be a link between increased motor development and babies who participate in swimming lessons. Swimming lessons may also help decrease the risk of drowning and improve deck behavior in kids. Classes that include both parents and the child are most beneficial for young children."}
{"question": "How tall is the newborn?", "answer": "Reasoning: Newborns have an average length and height. Boys and girls may have different heights at birth. There are factors that can influence the height of a newborn, such as genetics or maternal nutrition. The height of a newborn may have a correlation with birth weight. A newborn's height may be related to other developmental milestones, such as when they start crawling or walking. Newborns are not all the same height. Newborns can be measured for height immediately after birth. A newborn's height is not necessarily a crucial indicator of their health. Newborns do not necessarily have a specific 'normal' height.\nAnswer: Length or height is an important measurement that will help gauge your child's growth until they are possibly into their 20s. The average normal birth length for newborns is 19-20 inches. However, like any growth chart, it can also be normal to be a little smaller or a little bigger than this guideline. Babies who are born prematurely will usually be smaller as well. Term babies are those babies who are between 39 and 42 weeks gestation."}
{"question": "How to lose baby weight after birth?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a rate at which postpartum weight loss is considered healthy. Daily routines and habits may play a role in postpartum weight loss. Seeking guidance from a nutritionist or dietitian may be advisable for postpartum weight loss. There are safe ways to lose weight in the postpartum period. There may be specific nutrition and exercise plans that target weight gained during pregnancy. Gaining weight during pregnancy is normal. There is a specific or recommended way to lose baby weight after pregnancy. I need to prioritize weight loss over my overall health.\nAnswer: Healthy newborns are expected to lose between 7 and 10 percent of their birth weight. Generally, your pediatrician won't discharge your baby from the hospital if they have lost more than 10 percent, or a feeding plan and early follow-up appointment will be in place. Most newborns are back up to their birth weight by the time they are 2 weeks old. Newborns usually gain about 1 ounce or 30 grams a day for the first 30 days of life."}
{"question": "Is the Covid vaccine safe for my six month old?", "answer": "Reasoning: My baby is at risk of getting Covid. Certain vaccines are safe for babies while others are not. The Covid vaccine is not safe for infants as young as six months. Vaccines for older children and adults are generally safe for infants as well. Vaccinating my six-month-old is necessary for their overall health. There is a recommended age for receiving the Covid vaccine, and it may not include infants as young as six months. There are specific guidelines or recommendations from health authorities regarding Covid vaccination for infants aged six months. There may be potential benefits of vaccinating a six-month-old against Covid. There may be known risks or side effects associated with administering the Covid vaccine to a six-month-old. The Covid vaccine may not have been tested specifically on infants in clinical trials. The effectiveness of the Covid vaccine in preventing infection in infants, particularly those as young as six months, may vary.\nAnswer: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for everyone six months and older. The COVID-19 vaccine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for children and adults, verifying its safety. The benefits of receiving the vaccine outweigh the small risk of adverse reaction. People who receive the vaccine may experience normal side effects, similar to those of other vaccines, like a fever and localized swelling. It's safe for kids to get the COVID-19 vaccine on the same day they receive other routine vaccinations."}
{"question": "Is a change in body temperature a sign of labor?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are identifiable signs of labor during pregnancy. A change in body temperature can be a sign of labor. A change in body temperature could be a sign of infection rather than the onset of labor. Monitoring body temperature is a way to determine if I am in labor. An increase in body temperature may be a consistent and reliable sign of labor onset. There may be a normal range of temperature increase during the early stages of labor. Other factors unrelated to labor can cause a temporary change in body temperature. Different types of body temperature measurements may be more indicative of impending labor. A decrease in body temperature may signify the onset of labor. There may be a typical timeframe between a change in body temperature and the active phase of labor. There may be instances where women experience no change in body temperature despite being in labor.\nAnswer: Limited studies have shown that a woman's body temperature can slightly increase during labor. However, to keep track of your basal body temperature and be able to recognize this presents some challenges. To accurately take a basal body temperature, you must take your baseline temperature before getting out of bed in the morning and before making any movements. Pregnant women typically get up during the night to use the bathroom, and this can affect your circadian rhythm, which in turn can affect your basal body temperature. There are many other signs of labor that are more easily recognized."}
{"question": "When should I start looking for a Pediatrician?", "answer": "Reasoning: I need to find a pediatrician before my baby is born. I can obtain a pediatrician before my baby is born. I should wait until after my baby is born to find a pediatrician. Choosing a Pediatrician is an easy and simple process. I will only need a pediatrician when my child is sick. There is a recommended timeline for starting the search for a pediatrician during pregnancy. There may be advantages to initiating the search for a pediatrician before the baby is born. There are key factors to consider when determining the timing to start looking for a pediatrician. The early selection of a pediatrician can contribute to better healthcare planning for the newborn. There may be potential challenges or limitations if I wait until after the baby is born to choose a pediatrician.\nAnswer: A good rule of thumb is to identify a pediatrician about three months before your baby is due. This way you have ample time to make your decision, and if you go into labor prematurely you have already identified your provider of choice. It is also smart to verify that the provide you choose is covered by your specific insurance. Please note that some hospitals may not discharge you from the hospital until you are able to schedule a 2-3 day follow up appointment for baby with their pediatrician."}
{"question": "How do babies feel emotions?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies can experience emotions. Babies feel their emotions differently than adults. Infants can express emotions through non-verbal cues. Infants can appropriately articulate their emotions. Infants experience and understand emotions in a meaningful way. Babies begin to experience emotions at an early age. Genetics play a role in shaping a baby's emotional responses. Caregivers influence a baby's emotional development. Facial expressions and body language can indicate a baby's emotions. Newborns and infants express emotions differently than older babies. Cultural factors may play a role in a baby's emotional experiences. Developmental milestones can relate to changes in a baby's emotional expression.\nAnswer: Babies are expert observers and you may notice that by the time your baby is two months old, they will spend hours each day watching and listening to those around them. They learn that these people entertain them, soothe them, feed them, and make them comfortable. Babies between one to three months old will develop a social smile, enjoy playing, communicate more with their face and body, and imitate some facial expressions. Infants also can recognize emotional expressions in others after about six months of age."}
{"question": "What should I do if my baby has a cold?", "answer": "Reasoning: Colds in infants can be managed at home without medical attention. Over-the-counter cold medications designed for adults may not be safe for use in infants. Antibiotics may not always be necessary to treat a baby's cold. There may be a point at which seeking medical attention for a baby's cold is necessary. There may be differentiating factors between a common cold and a more serious illness in babies. There are typical symptoms associated with a cold in infants. The duration of a typical cold in infants may vary. There may be specific signs that indicate a baby's cold is worsening rather than improving.\nAnswer: If your baby has a cold, like with an adult, it's important to offer them plenty of fluids and ensure they have a normal amount of dirty and wet diapers. Ensure your baby is able to breathe clearly, and if needed utilize the bulb syringe if you can see mucus in their nose. Like in adults, the common cold has no cure and antibiotics are not effective. Generally, it will clear up in about 10 days. Unless your pediatrician has told you differently, over the counter medications are generally avoided in infants. If there temperature is above 100.4, call your provider or make an appointment. Your doctor will weigh your baby and can let you know what amount of Tylenol may be safe to give them to lower their temperature."}
{"question": "What is the advantage for not having an epidural during the labor?", "answer": "Reasoning: Not having an epidural during labor allows for more mobility. There are potential benefits to being able to change positions freely without an epidural. Avoiding an epidural can impact the overall labor experience for the mother. Not having an epidural allows for a more active role for the mother in the birthing process. Avoiding an epidural contributes to a more natural and unmedicated birthing experience. The absence of an epidural can impact the duration of the labor process. There are potential benefits to not having an epidural in terms of reduced risk for certain medical interventions during labor. Not having an epidural means a more 'natural' birthing experience. Avoiding an epidural allows for more control and active participation in the birthing process. There may be negative side effects or complications associated with epidurals. Avoiding an epidural may be safer for both the mother and the baby. Pain during labor is considered a normal and manageable part of childbirth. Avoiding an epidural is a way to embrace the experience of pain during labor. Having an epidural could potentially interfere with the bonding experience between the mother and the baby immediately after birth. Having an epidural may prolong the labor process. Not having an epidural may guarantee a faster recovery after childbirth. Women who choose not to have an epidural are more likely to have a positive birth experience.\nAnswer: An epidural is the most common and effective method of providing pain relief during childbirth. Although the epidural may not take away all sensations (especially those pressure sensations), for many women they are very effective at getting rid of sharp pain. As with any medical procedure, there are small risks of side effects and complications. Side effects can include low blood pressure, itchy skin, and headaches. Rarely people may experience blood clots in the spine, infections, and nerve damage. Women who opt not to have an epidural will be able to get up and move around more quickly after their baby is born and are not at risk for these side effects."}
{"question": "Is it normal for baby to move more than usual when closer to due date?", "answer": "Reasoning: Increased fetal movement near the due date does not necessarily indicate a problem or distress. Increased fetal movement does not mean that labor is imminent. Feeling sharp or sudden movements does not necessarily mean that the baby is uncomfortable or distressed. Increased movement does not necessarily mean that the baby is not in the correct position for birth. Feeling constant movement does not necessarily mean that the baby is in distress. Fetal movement patterns can vary between pregnancies and babies. Increased movement does not necessarily mean that the baby is larger-than-average. There are factors that contribute to changes in fetal movement as the due date approaches. There are specific patterns or types of movements that are considered normal during the later stages of pregnancy. The baby's growth and development can influence their movement in the womb towards the end of pregnancy. It may not be necessary to be concerned if there is a significant increase in fetal movement close to the due date. The baby's positioning in the uterus can play a role in their movements during the final weeks of pregnancy. The positioning of the placenta can affect fetal movement, especially as the due date approaches.\nAnswer: Kick counts are waiting for an hour and counting the baby's movements, or timing how long it takes for the baby to move 10 times. Fetal movement is a sign of well-being, and lets you know that your baby is not stressed. As your baby approaches the due date, you may actually notice that the movements aren't as dramatic and big. This is simply because your baby has less room to move. You may also notice your baby doesn't move as much during the day while you are up and moving, but you may notice when you lay down at night your little one is moving like crazy. It is always advisable to go to labor and delivery or the emergency room if you don't feel your baby moving or if you notice a big change in your baby's movements and something seems wrong."}
{"question": "What does contractions feel like?", "answer": "Reasoning: Contractions may not be experienced in the same way by all women. Contractions may not always be intensely painful. It may not be immediately obvious when experiencing contractions. Contractions may not only happen during active labor. Contractions may involve sensations other than just pain. The experience of contractions may vary between pregnancies. The primary physical sensation during contractions may vary. Contractions may be felt in different areas of the body. There may be a distinct pattern or rhythm to the timing of contractions. The pain of contractions may vary on a scale from 1 to 10. The sensation of contractions may change as labor progresses. There may be a similarity between the sensation of contractions and menstrual cramps.\nAnswer: When you first start having contractions when you are pregnant, you may not even notice you are having them. In the second and third trimester, it's common to have what are known as Braxton Hicks contractions. These are practice contractions that are helping your uterus prepare for labor. If you do feel them they may feel like tightening of your uterus, or even low back pain that is coming and going. Generally, these contractions aren't regular and they also may stop or change with activity. That is one way to distinguish them from labor contractions. Labor contractions gradually get stronger, and you may not be able to talk or walk while you are having one. Contractions also become much more intense when your water breaks, as you no longer have the cushion of amniotic fluid."}
{"question": "What can I do about ligament pain?", "answer": "Reasoning: Ligament pain is a normal part of pregnancy. Ligament pain does not necessarily mean there is something wrong with the baby or the pregnancy. Ligament pain is not always a sign of premature labor or a complication. Ligament pain may not persist throughout the entire pregnancy. There are self-care measures that can be taken to alleviate ligament pain. There may be specific exercises or stretches that pregnant women can do to help with ligament pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers may be effective for managing ligament pain during pregnancy. There may be prescription medications that can help manage ligament pain during pregnancy.\nAnswer: Unfortunately for the moms who experience it, round ligament pain is a normal and common symptom of pregnancy. If it is not your first pregnancy, you may notice the pain is worse, as your ligaments are more stretched than a first time mom. This pain generally gets worse throughout your second and third trimester as these ligaments stretch more to accommodate your growing uterus. Light stretching, taking a break to rest if the pain becomes intense, and wearing an elastic belly band for support are a few things you can do to help. You may also consult your provider to ensure that its safe, but generally you may also take Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy to help with some of these normal discomforts."}
{"question": "When does breast milk dry out?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breast milk drying out is influenced by various factors. Breast milk may take a certain amount of time to dry out after weaning. There may be signs or symptoms that indicate the drying out of breast milk. Breast milk can dry out gradually or suddenly. Hormonal changes may play a role in the cessation of breast milk production. Breast milk drying out is not solely based on the baby's age.\nAnswer: Weaning is the process of your baby moving from breastfeeding to other sources of nourishment. Making the decision of when to wean is a personal one that includes many factors. One approach to weaning is to drop one feeding session per week until your child takes all the feeds from a bottle or cup. Another method is to leave the decision of when to wean up to the child; children who are eating three meals a day often breastfeed less and less. In that case, a mom's milk supply will gradually dry up from lack of demand."}
{"question": "Why do I feel baby kicking in my pelvic area?", "answer": "Reasoning: Feeling kicks in the pelvic area does not necessarily mean the baby is positioned low or that labor will start soon. Kicks in the pelvic region do not necessarily mean the baby is breech. Feeling kicks in the pelvic area does not necessarily indicate that the baby is uncomfortable or in distress. The position of the baby cannot be determined solely by the location of kicks. Feeling kicks in the pelvic area does not necessarily mean the baby is large or has a higher birth weight. There may be specific fetal developmental milestones associated with feeling kicks in the pelvic region. It may be normal to feel baby kicks more in the pelvic area during certain trimesters of pregnancy. The position of the baby in the uterus can affect the sensation of kicks in the pelvic region. There may be variations in the perception of pelvic kicks based on the mother's body shape or size. The intensity or frequency of pelvic kicks may provide insights into the baby's health or development. The baby's growth and movement patterns may play a role in the sensation of kicks in the pelvic area.\nAnswer: As you grow closer and closer to your due date, your baby and uterus both may \"drop\" gradually. You may notice that instead of carrying your baby high, it may appear to be lower. This is because as you approach labor and delivery your baby descends into your pelvis. This is commonly referred to as dropping or lightening. If your baby is breech or feet down, you may very well feel kicking in this area. If your baby is head down, you may be feeling the movements of your baby's head and arms in that region."}
{"question": "What is considered a fever for a baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: A baby's normal body temperature may be different from an adult's. There is a definition of a fever that is different for newborns compared to older infants. There is a normal range of body temperature for a healthy baby, and it varies with age. There may be variations in body temperature that can be considered normal for a baby. Not all temperature elevations in a baby are a cause for concern or considered a fever. There is a temperature that is generally considered a low-grade fever in a baby. There is a temperature at which a fever is typically considered moderate or high for a baby.\nAnswer: Depending on your baby's medical history, your provider may give you personalized information, but generally you should call your provider or go in to have your baby seen promptly if they have a rectal temperature of 100.4 or greater if your baby is under three months. If your baby is older than three months, seek care if their temperature is greater than 102.2. This advice may differ if your baby has a health problem like cancer or sickle cell disease."}
{"question": "How do I help heartburn?", "answer": "Reasoning: I can't take any medications for heartburn during pregnancy because it might harm the baby. Heartburn is a normal and inevitable part of pregnancy that I just have to endure. Avoiding all spicy and acidic foods will eliminate heartburn during pregnancy. Drinking milk is an effective and immediate remedy for heartburn during pregnancy. I should avoid all caffeine to prevent heartburn during pregnancy. Heartburn medications are harmful to the developing baby, so I should avoid them entirely. There are dietary changes that can alleviate heartburn during pregnancy. There are specific foods that should be avoided to minimize heartburn symptoms. The timing of meals can impact heartburn in pregnant women. There may be recommended sleeping positions or postures to reduce heartburn during pregnancy. There may be over-the-counter antacids or medications that are safe to use for heartburn during pregnancy. Weight gain during pregnancy may relate to the occurrence of heartburn, and there may be strategies to manage it. There may be certain times of the day when heartburn is more likely to occur during pregnancy, and this information can guide preventive measures.\nAnswer: Heartburn is a common symptom of pregnancy, as your hormones relax your esophagus and food that is digesting can move back and forth. It may gradually worsen as your uterus expands and pushes the stomach up. If you are experiencing severe heartburn, you can discuss with your provider if an over the counter medication or prescription may be appropriate for you. Some things you can do to help with the intensity are avoiding foods that make it worse. Often this includes fatty foods, citrus, caffeine and carbonated beverages. Eating small meals throughout the day and drinking liquid between meals instead of with them can also help. Ensure you eat a few hours before laying down."}
{"question": "How can I know if my baby ate too much?", "answer": "Reasoning: If my baby finishes a bottle or breastfeeds until they seem content, it does not necessarily mean they have eaten an appropriate amount. Encouraging my baby to eat as much as possible may not be beneficial for their health. Spitting up after a feeding does not always mean my baby has eaten too much. My baby may still show signs of hunger even after a feeding, but it does not mean I should continue feeding to ensure they are satisfied. My baby may not stop eating when they've had enough, so I may need to intervene. Sleeping longer after a big feeding does not always mean my baby is well-nourished and content. Overfeeding can be a concern for both formula-fed and breastfed babies. Fussiness or crying does not always mean my baby is still hungry and needs to be fed more.  There may be specific behaviors or reactions my baby exhibits when they have eaten too much. There are recommended feeding guidelines based on my baby's age and weight. The frequency of feeding my baby and indications of satisfaction without overfeeding may vary. My baby's age plays a role in determining how much is too much to eat. There may be physical cues, such as a distended belly, that indicate my baby may have eaten excessively.\nAnswer: On average, newborns drink about 1.5-3 ounces every 2-3 hours. This amount gradually increases as your baby grows and can eat more at each feeding. By two months, your baby may have 4-6 ounces every 3-4 hours. By six months, this may increase to 6-8 ounces 4-5 times a day. When bottle feeding your baby, give them a break to burp about every 1-2 ounces. Pay attention to the clues they give you that they may be full: sucking with less force, stopping, or turning away from the bottle. Keep in mind that due to their immature digestive tracts, it can be normal for them to spit up after feeding. If you are concerned about the amount or frequency that your baby spits up, consult your provider."}
{"question": "How do I give my baby their first bath?", "answer": "Reasoning: I should not give my baby their first bath immediately after coming home from the hospital. Bathing my baby every day may not be necessary for their hygiene. I may not need to use soap and shampoo for my baby's first bath. I may not need to submerge my baby's entire body in the water during the first bath. I may not be able to use any type of baby wash or shampoo for my newborn. Bathing my baby in a regular adult bathtub may not be fine. I may not need to wash my baby's hair during every bath. I may not be able to use any towel for my baby after their bath. I need supplies and knowledge to bathe my baby for the first time. There are appropriate methods for cleaning my baby in the bath for the first time. There is a best way to cleanse my baby for the first time. There are safety precautions that I should take into consideration when bathing my baby for the first time.\nAnswer: Generally after 12-24 hours, if your baby has had a stable temperature, it is safe to give them their first bath. Keep in mind that until their umbilical cord falls off, they need sponge baths that keep their cord dry. Prepare your supplies ahead of time as your baby can get cold quickly. Start by washing your baby's face, and keep the body parts you aren't washing covered up by a warm towel. Always use touch supervision when bathing your baby - have all the supplies close enough that you are keeping a hand on them at all times."}
{"question": "Do babies breath heavily when they sleep?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a difference in breathing patterns between when a baby is awake and when they are sleeping. Heavy breathing in babies during sleep may not always be a cause for concern. Babies may not need to breathe as quietly as possible during sleep for optimal health. Heavy breathing during sleep may not always be a sign that a baby is not getting enough oxygen. Breathing heavily during sleep may not always be a sign of a respiratory infection or illness. There is a normal breathing pattern for a sleeping baby. Occasional heavy breaths or sighs during sleep may be normal for infants. There are factors that can contribute to heavy breathing in a sleeping baby. There may be specific sleep positions that can affect a baby's breathing pattern. There may be a point at which heavy breathing during sleep should be a cause for concern.\nAnswer: Newborns have very different sleep patterns than adults, and you may be surprised what a noisy sleeper your new family member is. Breathing while sleeping is often irregular, and may stop for 5-10 seconds followed by a period of rapid breathing until the cycle repeats. Kids usually outgrow this by the time they are about six months old. You may notice your baby is a noisy breather, which is caused by laryngomalacia or a floppy voice box. This condition will improve by the time your baby is one year old. If your baby is having trouble breathing, has blue skin or lips, feeding problems, or poor weight gain call the doctor right away."}
{"question": "What is the best way to bathe a baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a recommended method for bathing a baby. There are specific supplies needed to effectively clean a baby. There is a specific way in which a baby should be bathed. There are techniques for cleaning a baby's skin and hair to avoid their discomfort. There may be specific considerations for bathing premature or low-weight babies. Bathing a baby should not only be done when they are visibly dirty. Bathing a baby every day may not be necessary for cleanliness. A baby may need to be able to sit up independently before using the regular bathtub.\nAnswer: Keep in mind that during bath time, you should always have a hand on your baby. Preparation is key: make sure you have all your supplies gathered beforehand. The safest way to bathe your baby is in a small, hard plastic tub. Bath seats are not encouraged as they may tip over and babies have drowned. Some parents bathe their baby in a sink, but keep in mind that faucets and other sink hardware may pose risk for injury. You should never bathe your baby in a sink with running water. When bathing, make sure you begin with baby's face and move down from there in a head to toe fashion. Babies only need about three baths per week for their first year. Bathing too frequently can dry out their skin."}
{"question": "Should I wake up a baby at night to feed?", "answer": "Reasoning: Waking up a baby at night to feed is necessary for proper growth and development. There is a specific feeding schedule for babies. There are specific recommendations for nighttime feeding. Infants may need to be woken up from sleep in the night to be fed. There may be changes in an infant's feeding schedule that require them to be woken up throughout the night. There may be benefits to waking a baby up and feeding at night.\nAnswer: Your baby's feeding schedule is closely related to their weight gain, and is a conversation you must have with their pediatrician. Generally speaking, babies usually will sleep for 3-4 hours and must be awakened at the time to feed until they show good weight gain. This usually happens withing the first couple of weeks. After that, it's ok to let your baby sleep for longer periods at night. The first few months can be difficult for parents because some babies still wake up every 2-3 hours by 2-3 months of age. Developmentally, each baby is a little different and some may take longer to sleep through the night (considered sleeping for 5-6 hours)."}
{"question": "What are important vaccines for my baby to have?", "answer": "Reasoning: Vaccines are important for keeping babies healthy. There is a recommended vaccination schedule for infants. There are specific diseases or infections that vaccines protect babies from in the first few months of life. There may be specific vaccines that are particularly important based on a baby's health history or family medical history. There may be circumstances or conditions that would delay or alter the standard vaccination schedule. There is a difference between mandatory vaccines and recommended vaccines, and this may impact decision-making.\nAnswer: Immunization (vaccines) are a way to create immunity or protection from some diseases. Sometimes this is done by using small amounts of a killed or weakened germ that causes the disease. Other times the vaccine is a tiny part of the germ, like a piece of it's genetic material. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to react as if there were a real infection. It fends off the reaction and remembers the germ for later so it can fight it off if it encounters it again. The American Academy of Pediatrics has a vaccine schedule that shows all vaccines that are recommended at different ages. Your doctor will talk to you about what vaccines are right for your child."}
{"question": "What is the average size of a baby once born?", "answer": "Reasoning: The average size of a baby at birth can vary due to different factors. There may be differences in average birth size between male and female infants. Genetics may play a role in determining the average size of a newborn. The gestational age at birth can impact the average size of a baby. There is a normal range for the weight and length of a newborn. There may be trends or changes in average birth size over time.\nAnswer: Most term newborns (born between 37 and 40 weeks gestation) weigh between 5 pounds 8 ounces and 8 pounds 13 ounces. Newborns who are lighter or heavier than average are usually fine. There are many factors that affect what size your baby is born at. The size of the parents, multiple births, what number baby it is, gender, the mom's health during pregnancy, and nutrition during pregnancy all play a part. Premature babies are generally smaller and weigh less than other newborns. Their weight depends on how early they were born. Premature babies can require special medical attention right away after they are born, and may have a stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit."}
{"question": "How much time does the formula last?", "answer": "Reasoning: Not all infant formula has the same shelf life. Formula that has passed its expiration date may not be safe for consumption. Different types of infant formula may have different storage guidelines. The nutritional content of formula may change over time. The original packaging of formula may be important for maintaining its safety. There may be variations in the shelf life of different types of formulas from different brands. The shelf life of a powdered formula may differ depending on whether it has been opened or not. The expected duration of formula may vary depending on the frequency of feeding the baby.\nAnswer: Once you prepare formula, it can spoil if left out at room temperature. If you prepare formula to use ahead of time, it can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. If you prepare and leave at room temperature it's good for two hours. Throw out any formula that's left in the bottle after you feed your baby. The combination of infant formula and the baby's saliva can cause bacteria to grow. Clean and sanitize the bottle before using it again. Most infant formulas need to be used within one month of opening, but check your container for more specific guidance."}
{"question": "Is Vicks harmful for babies?", "answer": "Reasoning: Vicks is a product that is used for adults. There are active ingredients in Vicks products. The safety of these active ingredients for use in babies is not known. There may be potential side effects or risks associated with using Vicks on babies. There may be specific Vicks products designed or labeled for use in babies. There may be guidelines or recommendations regarding the use of Vicks in babies.\nAnswer: Vicks VapoRub is not safe for babies. When applied topically to babies and young children, there are serious adverse reactions such as seizures. The label specifically notes that it can't be used in children under two years of age. Vicks does have a product called BabyRub that is not medicated, and is safe for babies. When in doubt about any over the counter remedy, consult your pediatrician."}
{"question": "When to teach children to drink from cups?", "answer": "Reasoning: Children typically develop the motor skills necessary to hold and drink from a cup independently at a certain age. There are signs that indicate when a child is ready to transition from a bottle or sippy cup to a regular cup. There may be specific health or developmental milestones that parents should consider before introducing regular cups to their children. There are benefits and drawbacks to introducing a regular cup earlier or later in a child's development. The introduction of regular cups aligns with broader milestones in a child's independence and self-feeding skills. Introducing a cup to a child too early may cause confusion or interfere with breastfeeding or bottle feeding. Introducing a cup too late may lead to dependence on bottles, causing difficulties in breaking the habit. Children may resist learning to drink from cups, and it may be a challenging process. Parents should wait for a healthcare professional's recommendation before introducing cups to their children. Children need to be a certain age before introducing cups to avoid causing confusion.\nAnswer: Both pediatricians and dentists alike recommend that as your child moves to eating mainly solid foods there are many benefits to training them to drink from a cup. Ideally this transition can begin at around six months of age. Gradually, you'll reduce the number of bottle feedings and complete the transition between 12 and 18 months. Letting kids bottle feed for longer can cause them to skip meals, reach an unhealthy weight, develop cavities, and resist open cups even more. It can be totally normal for your child to be resistant at the beginning of this process, and it doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. Be patient and know that your little one will gradually begin to drink like a big kid."}
{"question": "Does intercourse help with labor?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are non-medical ways to help induce labor. Having intercourse can speed up the labor process if the water has already broken. Engaging in intercourse during late pregnancy can induce labor. Engaging in sexual activity can help soften the cervix and promote dilation. Intercourse can impact the body's release of oxytocin, which plays a role in the onset of labor. There are physiological changes that occur during sexual activity that could potentially stimulate the initiation of labor. There may be specific components of semen, such as prostaglandins, that are believed to have a role in inducing labor. Medical professionals may recommend intercourse as a natural method to help induce labor. There may be scientific studies or evidence supporting the idea that sexual activity can contribute to the onset of labor in pregnant individuals.\nAnswer: There is limited evidence suggesting that sexual intercourse can induce labor. Semen contains prostaglandins, and that may help some women progress towards labor, but more research is needed on this. Some studies suggest that the act of having sex can stimulate the lower uterine segment, and that may affect some women. If there is any nipple stimulation involved, this can release oxytocin which can stimulate contractions. There is a recognized need for more research on this complicated subject. Be sure to consult your provider to see what is right for you and your partner as you approach your due date."}
{"question": "What toothbrush brand should I use for a baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: The toothbrush I used for my older child may not be suitable for my baby. Babies may need a toothbrush before they have all their teeth. The price of a toothbrush does not necessarily determine its effectiveness for my baby's oral health. The toothbrush brand I select may have an impact on my baby's oral health. Toothbrushes for babies have different features depending on the brand. An infant's oral health is important for their overall health. The American Dental Association (ADA) may have recommendations on toothbrush brands for babies. Certain toothbrush brands may offer age-appropriate designs and themes for babies. There may be toothbrush brands specifically formulated for infants with teething discomfort.\nAnswer: Tooth decay is one of the most common childhood diseases in the U.S., but luckily there are ways to prevent it. As soon as your baby's first tooth appears, there are habits you can start to keep it healthy. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentists tells us that any soft-bristled toothbrush with a small head, preferably one designed for infants will work, and you should use it at least once a day at bedtime. Taking your child to the dentist regularly, starting when their first tooth erupts will allow the dentist to recommend a specific program of brushing and flossing."}
{"question": "How do I introduce solids to my four-month-old baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: Four months is the appropriate age to start introducing solids to a baby. There is a recommended order or process for introducing solids to a baby. There are specific solid foods that are best for initial introduction to a baby. Solid foods should be introduced gradually. There is an age at which a baby should be solely on solid food.\nAnswer: It is typically not recommended to introduce solids to a four-month-old baby. Before introducing solids to baby, make sure baby can sit up unassisted. The American Academy of Pediatrics says that for most children, you do not need to give foods in a certain order. Your child can begin eating solid foods at about 6 months old. By the time he or she is 7 or 8 months old, your child can eat a variety of foods from different food groups.  Most babies this age are ready to try solid foods. Experts recommend starting solid foods when a baby is about 6 months old, depending on the baby's readiness and nutritional needs. Does your baby swallow food or push it out of their mouth? Babies have a natural tongue-thrust reflex that pushes food back out. Wait until this reflex disappears (typically when babies are 4-6 months old). Can your baby support their own head? To eat solid food, an infant needs good head and neck control and should be able to sit up. Is your baby interested in food? Babies who stare, reach and grab, and open their mouths for food are ready to try solid foods. Be sure to check with your doctor before giving any solid food.  While there is no strict rule and each child develops at a different pace, full-term babies typically hit the mealtime milestone at 4 to 6 months of age. At 4 to 6 months old, children naturally become more aware and interested in their environment. As parents know all too well, this is also the stage when they're orally fixated to the point that they will try to put everything in their mouth. This is a signal it may be a good time to start introducing solid foods. Before making the switch to solids, a child must have good head control, and have outgrown their tongue-thrust reflex, meaning they no longer push food away with their tongue. When ready for solids, your child will open their mouth to accept food without spitting or pushing it out. But because it's a new experience, the first few times may not go smoothly -- even if your baby is ready. Keep trying if they spit out their food! Babies who are ready to try solid foods will show interest in what family members are eating. They should also be capable of moving food from a spoon to their mouth and swallow without choking. parents to ask their pediatrician questions around their baby's 4-month checkup. Your pediatrician can help you learn about how to introduce solid foods to your baby safely, as well as help you decide when to do it."}
{"question": "What is GBS and what does it mean to be GBS positive?", "answer": "Reasoning: Being GBS positive can be dangerous for a baby. There is a test for GBS that is done during pregnancy. There are risks to the mother if she is GBS positive. There are risks to the baby if exposed to GBS. Not all babies exposed to GBS become sick. GBS can cause illness. There are measures that can be taken to prevent a baby from becoming sick with GBS.\nAnswer: GBS stands for Group B streptococcus which is a type of bacteria that can be found in the vagina. This bacteria can be found the vagina of many women without causing a problem. However, for some pregnant women, this can cause problems. To be safe, your doctor will prescribe you an antibiotic to treat the bacteria infection. GBS stands for Group B streptococcus which is a type of bacteria that can be found in the vagina. This bacteria can be found the vagina of many women without causing a problem. However, for some pregnant women, this can cause problems. To be safe, your doctor will prescribe you an antibiotic to treat the bacteria infection. Group B Streptococcus (group B strep, GBS) is a type of bacteria often found in the urinary tract, digestive system, and reproductive tracts. The bacteria come and go from our bodies, so most people who have it don't know that they do. GBS usually doesn't cause health problems. About 1 out of every 4 women have GBS. In pregnant women, GBS can cause infection of the urinary tract, placenta, womb, and amniotic fluid. Even if they haven't had any symptoms of infection, pregnant women can pass the infection to their babies during labor and delivery. Pregnant women are routinely tested for GBS late in the pregnancy, usually between weeks 35 and 37. The test is simple, inexpensive, and painless. Called a culture, it involves using a large cotton swab to collect samples from the vagina and rectum. These samples are tested in a lab to check for GBS. The results are usually available in 1 to 3 days. If a test finds GBS, the woman is said to be \"GBS-positive.\" This means only that she has the bacteria in her body -- not that she or her baby will become sick from it. Doctors will test a pregnant woman to see if she has GBS. If she does, she will get intravenous (IV) antibiotics during labor to kill the bacteria. Doctors usually use penicillin but can give other medicines if a woman is allergic to. It's best for a woman to get antibiotics for at least 4 hours before delivery. This simple step greatly helps to prevent the spread of GBS to the baby."}
{"question": "Can I freeze breast milk that has been refrigerated all day?", "answer": "Reasoning: Once breast milk has been in the refrigerator, it can be frozen. There may be some risks associated with freezing breast milk that has been refrigerated all day. There is a recommended refrigeration temperature for breast milk. There is a point at which it is considered too many days to transfer refrigerated breast milk to the freezer.\nAnswer: Yes, pumped breast milk that has been refrigerated can be frozen within 24 hours of being pumped. Breastmilk is OK for up to 4 hours after pumping at room temperature (up to 77°F). Breastmilk is OK in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. If you're not going to use refrigerated breastmilk within 4 days of pumping, freeze it right after pumping. You can put breastmilk in a cooler or insulated cooler pack with frozen ice packs for up to 24 hours after pumping. After 24 hours in a cooler the breastmilk should be refrigerated or frozen."}
{"question": "Is it best for pregnant women to avoid caffeine altogether?", "answer": "Reasoning: Caffeine can have negative effects on pregnant women. Caffeine can have negative effects on a baby in utero. There are common sources of caffeine. There may be a lower limit for caffeine intake that does not cause harm.\nAnswer: If you're pregnant, check with your doctor about having caffeine. It's usually OK to have 1 or 2 cups of coffee, but it's best not to have more than that. Studies show that getting more than 200 milligrams of caffeine a day during pregnancy may not be healthy. This is about how much is in a 12-ounce cup or two 6-ounce cups of coffee. Drinking lots of caffeine during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage, low birth weight, and possibly other pregnancy problems. \tHaving too much caffeine during pregnancy may increase the risk of complications, including miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight and/or having a baby who is small for their gestational age. Some women find they become more sensitive to caffeine during pregnancy, reporting that even small amounts make them feel jittery and anxious. Caffeine can also affect sleep, causing pregnancy insomnia and it may make morning sickness worse. Another side effect is more frequent urination (needing to wee more often) and bladder irritation. It is always best to discuss caffeine consumption with your provider to be safe"}
{"question": "Can I refrigerate unused thawed breast milk?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breast milk must be placed in the refrigerator within a certain time frame after it is thawed. There are potential risks associated with using refrigerated thawed breast milk. There is a time limit for how long refrigerated thawed breast milk can be used. Bacteria can grow in breast milk after it is thawed. The baby can become sick if fed thawed then refrigerated breast milk.\nAnswer: No, once breast milk has been thawed, it should be discarded within 24 hours if it is not used; No, unused thawed breast milk should be thrown out if not used within 24 hours after being thawed out. If breastmilk is thawed to room temperature or warmed, it should be discarded if not used within 2 hour. Breastmilk should be used within 24 hours of thawing it in the refrigerator. This means 24 hours from when the breastmilk is no longer frozen, not from when you take it out of the freezer. Once breastmilk is thawed to room temperature or warmed after being in the refrigerator or freezer, use it within 2 hours. If you have any leftover milk when the baby is finished feeding, be sure to throw it out within 2 hours. Do not refreeze breastmilk after it has been thawed."}
{"question": "Is it normal for blood to come out of the small bumps around my nipple during pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are small bumps around the nipple during pregnancy. It is possible for blood to come out of the small bumps around the nipple during pregnancy. Blood from the small bumps around the nipple may not be a sign of a serious condition. It may be necessary for a woman to see her doctor if there is blood coming from the small bumps around the nipple.\nAnswer: A few women may have occasional leakage of blood from the nipple. This is due to an increase in the number and size of blood vessels. Although this can be normal during pregnancy, it's best to get any leakage of blood from the nipple checked by your GP."}
{"question": "Can sudden movements from my baby cause shaken baby syndrome?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a condition called shaken baby syndrome. There are certain situations or actions that can result in shaken baby syndrome. There are signs that indicate a baby may have shaken baby syndrome.\nAnswer: No, sudden movements by the baby are not strong enough to cause abusive head trauma, also known as, shake a baby syndrome alone. Head or neck injury from physical child abuse. It happens when someone shakes a baby or hits the baby against something hard. Most cases happen when a parent or caregiver is angry, tired, or upset because a baby won't stop crying or the child can't do something they expect, like toilet train. No, a newborn does not possess enough strength to cause abusive head trauma known as shaken a baby syndrome. Things like gently bouncing a baby on a knee or riding in a bumpy car won't cause the problems seen in abusive head trauma. Abusive head trauma happens when someone, uses force to shake a child, uses force to throw or drop a child on purpose, or hits the child's head or neck against an object, like the floor or furniture, or hits the child's head or neck with an object. Abusive head trauma (AHT), which includes shaken baby syndrome, is a severe form of physical child abuse. It results in injury to the brain of a child. AHT is a leading cause of physical child abuse deaths in children under 5 in the U.S. Babies less than 1 year old are at the greatest risk of injury from AHT. AHT can be prevented.  Shaking, hitting, throwing, or dropping babies and toddlers can have dangerous results. A baby's neck muscles can't support the stress of shaking. When the baby is shaken, its head moves in a sudden whiplash motion that can cause bleeding inside the head and increased pressure on the brain. Shaking, hitting, throwing, or dropping baby or child can cause irreversible brain damage, learning disabilities, intellectual disability, blindness, deafness, seizures, paralysis or death. Babies who survive severe shaking will likely need lifelong medical care. Rapid or sudden movements by the newborn/infant cannot cause shaken baby syndrome."}
{"question": "Is it possible to start breastfeeding at 7 weeks?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breast milk production starts soon after delivery. Milk production may stop if no breastfeeding occurs. There may be techniques to start breast production at 7 weeks. It is possible to start breastfeeding at 7 weeks.\nAnswer: Relactation, which simply means starting up breastfeeding again after a period of not breastfeeding, takes diligence, work, and determination, but many have successfully done it. The key is having realistic expectations, learning a few tricks to increase your chances of success, having a strong support system -- and maybe most of all, being gentle with yourself along the way. Some women will be able to bring in a full supply within weeks. Some will take a bit longer, and some will never quite be able to bring back a full milk supply. Every ounce of breast milk counts, though, and making peace with what you have is vital when you're working on relactating. That said, there are some factors that will determine how successful you will be at relactation including: The younger your baby is, the easier it will be to relactate. Moms with babies in the 3 to 4 month range usually have the highest success rates. The more well established your milk supply was before weaning, the easier it will be to re-establish it. The more time you have to attempt breastfeeding and pumping, the better, as frequent and effective breastfeeding and pumping is the most important physiological factor for relactation. The more interested in breastfeeding your baby is, the easier this process will be. The more educated you are about how relactation works, the more success you'll have. The more support you have from family, friends, and healthcare providers, the more likely you'll be to persevere and not give up."}
{"question": "Can I refuse the gestational diabetes 3-hour test?", "answer": "Reasoning: A diabetes screening test is done in pregnancy. There is a specific time when a 3-hour gestational diabetes test is done. A positive 3-hour gestational diabetes test may indicate something. There may be potential harms associated with untreated gestational diabetes. I may be afraid to find out if I have diabetes from the test.\nAnswer: Yes, you can refuse the glucose screening. However, most major medical associations and pregnancy care providers recommend all pregnant people be screened for gestational diabetes. Glucose screenings are the only way to help your provider diagnose gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes puts you and the fetus at risk for complications."}
{"question": "Is 6 months too early to introduce a straw to my baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: Most babies can drink from a straw at a certain age. Babies may naturally know how to drink from a straw. There may be some potential dangers to a 6 month old drinking from a straw. I'm not sure if babies can suck through a straw at 6 months. Sucking through a straw could cause the baby to choke.\nAnswer: If introduced closer to 6 months, your baby might take to straw drinking immediately given his/her strong sucking reflex. Babies who are ~8+ months might need to be taught to close their lips and suck. There are two main methods for doing so:  Head Control - baby holds head upright and stable. Sitting - baby sits with minimal support. Reaching and grabbing - baby grabs objects and brings them to his/her mouth. Signs of interest - baby demonstrates interest in food (e.g., leans toward it). Transitioning from the bottle/breast to straw or open cup drinking can be both exciting and overwhelming. Cup and straw drinking is a skill that takes time to develop, but with practice and patience, your baby will be weaned from the bottle in no time!"}
{"question": "How much pain is normal when milk comes in?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breastfeeding initiation can sometimes be accompanied by pain. Breastfeeding can be associated with severe or significant pain. There are reasons for severe pain to occur when initiating breastfeeding. There may be something that can be done if severe breast pain persists after initiating breastfeeding. I've heard there is a lot of pain associated with milk letdown. A lot of pain with letdown likely indicates a problem like an infection or clogged duct.\nAnswer: During the first 2-5 days after birth, it's normal to have engorged (very full) breasts as your milk supply increases. But if your baby nurses (or you pump) every 2-3 hours, your breasts should not feel engorged. Although your breasts and nipples may be tender or uncomfortable, once your baby is well-latched, breastfeeding should not be painful. Sometimes pain can happen if you have an improper latch, a milk duct that is clogged with milk (plugged milk duct), a breast infection (mastitis), or other issues. If you have pain while breastfeeding, especially with a fever, talk with your doctor or nurse to figure out why. When your milk comes in, your breasts will become fuller and firmer. If your baby is feeding well and frequently, this should pass without problems. However, some women's breasts become rock hard, and they may also be tender, uncomfortable, even painful - a condition called breast engorgement. Engorged breasts may also feel fairly hot due to all the activity inside - it's like a traffic jam in there! Although it's only temporary, often lasting 24 to 48 hours, engorgement can also make it difficult for your baby to latch, as your nipples may become flattened."}
{"question": "Are baby clothes with magnetic snaps safe?", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be some benefits to using baby clothes with magnetic snaps. There may be some data suggesting harm to babies from clothes with magnetic snaps. There may be some non-magnetic safety issues associated with magnetic snaps. Magnetic fields can cause harm to babies. The time saved from using magnetic snaps may not be worth the potential risk.\nAnswer: The magnets used in clothing are very weak so as to prevent any injuries from the magnets snapping together. Magnets, especially those found in toys are heavily regulated by the CPSC. They only have enough pull to create an easy closure. As with any product, if you notice any holes or tears you would want to repair those issues and avoid using them until they are fixed to make sure a magnet couldn't fall out or rub your child's skin. However, a magnet detached from a piece of clothing might present a choking hazard in a baby. Though the risk is low, the magnetic clothing could also interfere with the function of devices such as pacemakers or defibrillators (or any other questionable medical implant). In that case, contact your doctor for further direction."}
{"question": "How will having an umbilical hernia repaired with mesh affect future pregnancies?", "answer": "Reasoning: Not all umbilical hernias need to be repaired. There may be problems that can occur during pregnancy with a history of umbilical hernia repair using mesh. There may be specific complications that can occur during pregnancy if an unrepaired umbilical hernia is present. An umbilical hernia repaired with mesh may pull loose and cause pain during pregnancy. An umbilical hernia repair with mesh may impede the growth of the stomach during pregnancy. A repeat umbilical hernia repair may be necessary after pregnancy.\nAnswer: Repairing umbilical hernias in women who may become pregnant in the future, regardless of whether they are sutured or repaired with a mesh, carries a higher risk of hernia recurrence. As the abdominal wall expands and contracts during pregnancy, the repaired hernia area may fail to hold the tissues together, leading to hernia recurrence. Mesh repair may not adequately cover the weakened area and result in recurrence.\r\nGiven the expansion of the abdominal wall during pregnancy, biomaterial characteristics of shrinkage and compliance should be considered. It has been previously shown that the flexibility of the abdominal wall may be restricted by large mesh implants.11 However, so far there are actually no data indicating that mesh repair of symptomatic ventral hernias should be prohibited in the reproductive woman who desires future pregnancy."}
{"question": "Is it possible to continue lactating indefinitely?", "answer": "Reasoning: Lactation can start and stop due to certain conditions. There are conditions that can cause lactation to continue. It is possible to continue lactating after discontinuing breast feeding. There may be cause for concern if a woman continues lactating long after discontinuing breast feeding. Some breast milk may be beneficial for young children after the infant stage.\nAnswer: The hormone prolactin controls the amount of milk you produce, and your body begins producing prolactin early in pregnancy. At first, the high levels of estrogen, progesterone and other pregnancy hormones suppress prolactin. Once you deliver the placenta, those pregnancy hormones drop and prolactin takes charge. Some people may stop producing over just a few days. For others, it may take several weeks for their milk to dry up completely. It's also possible to experience let-down sensations or leaking for months after suppressing lactation. Galactorrhea (guh-lack-toe-REE-uh) happens when your breasts unexpectedly produce milk or a milk-like discharge. This nipple discharge may leak from your breast on its own or when touched. It's not related to milk production in breastfeeding (chestfeeding) or pregnancy. Galactorrhea sometimes indicates an underlying health condition, but is most often caused by too much prolactin. If you experience this, talk to your healthcare provider"}
{"question": "Who can I call for advice on how to wean my baby off the breast?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are online or telephone resources available for weaning advice. There are steps involved in weaning a baby off the breast. I may not be able to figure out how to wean my baby on my own. Without guidance, I may wean my baby too early or too late.\nAnswer: There are several people and places that can help you when you are ready to wean your baby. You probably have many questions about breastfeeding and your baby's nutrition. There are many sources of information, including your pediatrician, family doctor, community health nurse, breastfeeding clinic, lactation consultant and La Leche League."}
{"question": "How common is it for mothers to be unable to produce breast milk?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a percentage of women who are unable to produce breast milk. There are common reasons that prevent women from producing breast milk. I may not be able to feed my baby with breast milk.\nAnswer: Stress is the No. 1 killer of breastmilk supply, especially in the first few weeks after delivery. Between lack of sleep and adjusting to the baby's schedule, rising levels of certain hormones such as cortisol can dramatically reduce your milk supply. Milk supply depends on demand (milk removal.) Feeding frequently, when your baby shows hunger cues, is the best way to have a good supply. If you are having trouble with delayed milk production or a decrease in the amount of milk, then first take a look at the number and length of your feedings. And make sure that your baby is able to put his or her mouth around your nipple to nurse (latch on) and can transfer milk from your breast.  If you've ever had a breast reduction, breast enhancement, mastectomy, or other breast surgery, your ability to breastfeed may be compromised. However, many women who have had breast surgery are able to produce breast milk. Some women will be able to exclusively nurse their babies. Other women won't make enough milk to meet their babies' nutritional needs and will need to supplement with donated breast milk or formula. Women who have had breast surgery and want to breastfeed should consultant a lactation consultant as soon as possible and work closely with the consultant after birth."}
{"question": "When is the earliest I can introduce a bottle without affecting breastfeeding?", "answer": "Reasoning: Feeding a baby with both a bottle and the breast may be possible. Introducing a bottle may make it harder for the baby to breastfeed. There may be an age at which introducing a bottle is less disruptive in combination with breastfeeding. It may be hard for me to breastfeed exclusively. I would like to breastfeed for a good amount of time.\nAnswer: Once breastfeeding is going well, your baby can begin drinking your breast milk from a bottle. You should avoid bottle feeding your baby if there are any problems with nursing at your breast because it can confuse your baby and increase the breastfeeding difficulties. After about four weeks of breastfeeding, begin pumping after one feeding a day where your breasts still feel a little full. Introducing the bottle for substitute or supplementary feedings before to 4 weeks has also been found to contribute to a decrease in milk production."}
{"question": "How worried should I be about slower rising hcg levels during pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: hCG levels are routinely checked throughout early pregnancy. A slower rate of hCG rise may indicate a problem. There are causes for a slower rising hCG level. There may be interventions or treatments available for problems associated with a slower rising hCG level.\nAnswer: Standard hCG levels vary quite massively from woman to woman. This is because hCG levels really depend on what is normal for you, how your body responds to pregnancy, as well as how many embryos you are carrying. The way a woman's body reacts to pregnancy is entirely unique. In early pregnancy, hCG levels usually double every two to three days. Interestingly, when the measurements start off high they don't expand at the same rate. If they start off more slowly, the increase ends up happening much quicker. If your hCG levels fall below the normal range, your doctor may want you to have a blood test every two to three days to ensure the levels are increasing. A single measurement of your hCG level is not useful. To give an accurate indication, a series of hCG blood tests needs to be taken a couple of days apart and the readings compared. There is often variation with a rapid increase in numbers, especially in the first few weeks of pregnancy."}
{"question": "How long is it necessary to stay in the hospital after birth?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is an average length of stay after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. There is an average length of stay after an uncomplicated C-section. Different complications can significantly increase the length of stay. Women may be discharged from the hospital too soon after giving birth. Staying in the hospital longer may help prevent complications after giving birth.\nAnswer: The length of your hospital stay will depend on a variety of factors. If you have a vaginal delivery, the usual stay is about 1 day and for Cesarean deliveries, the usual stay is about 2 days. Longer hospital stays increase the risk of medical interventions and hospital-acquired infections. Therefore, if your medical team deems you medically stable, recovery at home is recommended"}
{"question": "Should I prevent my 3 month old from napping at night?", "answer": "Reasoning: If a baby naps at night, they may not sleep through the night. There may be negative side effects of napping at night for a 3 month old. The negative side effects of napping at night may become less common as the baby ages. There may be benefits to preventing a 3 month old from napping at night if the baby is sleepy.\nAnswer: Most 3-month-old infants should be getting a total of 14 to 17 hours of sleep in 24 hoursTrusted Source. So, that means your little one should only be awake for 7 to 10 hours per 24-hour cycle. Of course, your 3-month-old isn't going to be awake for a full 8 hours at a time. During this stage, it's not unusual for little ones to wake for a few hours and then sleep for a few hours, around the clock. However, around 3 months, some babies will start to get on board with the whole days/nights thing and begin to sleep through the night for as many as 6 to 8 hours at a time -- a welcome change for sleep-deprived parents. Keep in mind that all babies are different, and each one reaches sleep milestones at their own pace. So, while one child might magically begin to sleep longer stretches at night, other babies (and their parents) might still be waking every few hours through the night. Decide on where your baby is going to sleep. Try to decide where your baby is going to sleep for the long run by 3 months of age as changes in sleeping arrangements will be harder on your baby as he gets older. For example, if your baby is sleeping in a bassinet, move him to a crib by 3 months.  Always practice the ABC's of safe sleep: Babies should always sleep Alone, on their Backs, in a Crib. Develop a daily sleep schedule. Babies sleep best when they have consistent sleep times and wake times. Note that cutting back on naps to encourage nighttime sleep results in overtiredness and a worse night's sleep."}
{"question": "Can doctors force interventions during labor?", "answer": "Reasoning: Doctors may recommend interventions during labor. There may be some situations where interventions are necessary during labor. There may be some potential repercussions for refusing recommended interventions during labor. There may be a question about whether women lose bodily autonomy when pregnant or in labor.\nAnswer: Historically, “informed\" consent meant the doctor informed a patient of his plan. In modern health care, informed consent involves the bidirectional sharing of information. The clinician informs a patient of her diagnosis, its natural history, available treatments, and their risks and benefits; the patient tells the clinician about her individual values, circumstances, and preferences. Based on his professional opinion, a clinician then recommends, offers, or recommends against a particular treatment or course of action. Knowledge of the ethical basis of informed consent can improve communication between clinicians and patients, strengthen the therapeutic alliance, and reduce harm when women refuse recommended care. A woman's autonomy trumps the beneficence of the doctor or State. Coercion and abandonment are ethically abhorrent and inappropriate in modern health care. Caregivers should not perform unsafe interventions; however, attendance in labor is not an intervention. Clinicians continuing to care for women who refuse advice are fulfilling their professional duty of care. Colleagues, professional organizations, hospital administrators, and the legal profession must recognize that respecting a woman's right to choose is not supporting her choice-ethical and legal liability for harm caused by her refusal is hers. Guidelines need to be written in a patient-centered manner that qualifies risk and incorporates women's choice. Remember that your doctor and midwife are there to support you throughout your labor and birth, and to make sure that you and your baby stay safe and healthy. They are trained to manage situations where the unexpected happens. In most situations where you doctor or midwife suggests an intervention, there will be time for them to explain why it is needed, and you will be able to discuss your options together. It's important to consider the risks and benefits of having an intervention to both you and your baby, as well as any risks associated with declining the intervention. You have the right to choose whether to have any intervention in your labor or birth. If you aren't sure whether you want an intervention, it's a good idea to ask your doctor or midwife for more information to help you decide. Many women also find it helpful to involve their partners or other support people when deciding. In an emergency, your doctor or midwife may decide what to do on your behalf to protect your health or your baby's health. If you are unconscious, your doctor or midwife may discuss this with your partner or family (if possible) to understand your preferences. In all situations, your doctor or midwife is legally required to act in your and your baby's best interest."}
{"question": "Can the baby blues last more than a couple of weeks?", "answer": "Reasoning: Baby blues are a real condition. Baby blues can last for a certain amount of time. There are causes of baby blues. Baby blues are different from postpartum depression.\nAnswer: Yes, Most new moms experience postpartum \"baby blues\" after childbirth, which commonly include mood swings, crying spells, anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Baby blues usually begin within the first 2 to 3 days after delivery and may last for up to two weeks. But some new moms experience a more severe, long-lasting form of depression known as postpartum depression. Sometimes it's called peripartum depression because it can start during pregnancy and continue after childbirth. Rarely, an extreme mood disorder called postpartum psychosis also may develop after childbirth. Postpartum depression is not a character flaw or a weakness. Sometimes it's simply a complication of giving birth. If you have postpartum depression, prompt treatment can help you manage your symptoms and help you bond with your baby.  It's common to have short spells of sadness or grouchiness after giving birth, because of the pain, change in hormone levels, and lack of sleep. But sometimes the feelings are extreme and won't go away. These feelings may be signs of postpartum depression. The \"baby blues\" can make a new mother feel alone, afraid, and exhausted. These feelings are common and normal. The baby blues are not as severe as postpartum depression and do not last as long. Women who suffer from postpartum depression are so overwhelmed by these feelings that they can't function normally. And these symptoms do not go away after the first two weeks after delivery. Women with postpartum depression feel hopeless and anxious. They may feel angry at their partner or at their baby. They may begin to wonder whether they are cut out for motherhood. It's important to know that although postpartum depression can be serious, it doesn't mean that you're unfit to be a parent. Pain from giving birth and changes in your body may contribute to the depression. The sudden drop in hormones and lack of sleep may also be factors. Postpartum depression can be treated. The sooner it is diagnosed, the sooner you can begin to enjoy the new member of your family. But you must get professional help to be diagnosed and treated."}
{"question": "How do you sterilize your bottles and pump supplies?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are different components of bottles and pump supplies that need to be sterilized. There is a specific way to sterilize the different components of bottles and pump supplies. There is a reason for sterilizing the components of bottles and pump supplies. Babies may be at risk of getting seriously ill if bottles and pump supplies are not sterilized correctly.\nAnswer: Before using your breast pump each time: Wash your hands well with soap and water for 20 seconds. Clean the pumping area. Use disinfectant wipes on the countertop where the pump and bottles will be placed during the session. If you use a dishwasher with hot water and a heated drying cycle (or sanitizing setting) to clean infant feeding items, a separate sanitizing step is not necessary. For extra germ removal, sanitize feeding items at least once daily. Sanitizing is particularly important when your baby is younger than 2 months, was born prematurely, or has a weakened immune system. Daily sanitizing of feeding items may not be necessary for older, healthy babies, if those items are cleaned carefully after each use. Before sanitizing, make sure you have cleaned feeding items, bottle brushes, and wash basins using one of the methods above. Sanitize all items (even the bottle brush and wash basin) by using one of the following options. Check with the item's manufacturer about which method to use. To boil: Place disassembled feeding items into a pot and cover with water. Put the pot over heat and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes. Remove items with clean tongs. To steam: Place disassembled items in microwave or plug-in steam system and follow the manufacturer's instructions for sanitizing, cooling, and drying the items. To bleach: (if you can't boil, steam, or use a dishwasher) Prepare a bleach solution of 2 teaspoons of unscented bleach per gallon (16 cups) of water in a clean wash basin. Put all items completely underwater. Make sure the solution touches all parts and there are no air bubbles in the bottles. Squeeze solution through nipple holes. Soak items in solution for at least 2 minutes. Remove with clean hands or tongs. Do not rinse because germs could get back onto the sanitized items. Any remaining bleach will break down quickly as it dries and will not hurt your baby. This process is similar to what is done to sanitize dishes in restaurants. After sanitizing, place items on a clean, unused dish towel or paper towel in an area protected from dirt and dust. Allow to air-dry thoroughly before storing. Do not use a dish towel to rub or pat items dry because doing so may transfer germs to the items. Assemble a clean pump kit. Check to make sure the pump kit or tubing has become dirty or moldy during storage. If your tubing is moldy, dispose of and replace it immediately. If you're sharing a pump, clean it. Be sure to clean the surface of the pump, including the power switch and dials. After using your breast pump each time: Store the milk safely. Cap the collection bottle or bag you're using and label with date and time it was pumped. Immediately put it in a refrigerator, freezer or coolerbag with ice packs. If the milk collection container will be stored at a hospital or child care center, be sure your name is on the label. Clean the pumping area. Especially if you're using a shared pump, clean the dials, power switch, and countertop with disinfectant wipes again. Take apart & inspect the pump kit. Take apart the breast pump tubing and separate all the parts that come in contact with the breast and/or breast milk. This includes flanges, valves, membranes, connectors and milk collection bottles. Rinse & clean the pump kit. Rinse the breast pump parts that come into contact with the breast and/or breast milk. Hold them under running water to remove any remaining milk. As soon as possible after pumping, clean the pump parts that come into contact with the breast and/or breast milk in one of the following ways."}
{"question": "Are contractions similar to IBS pains?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a condition called IBS and it causes pain. There is a difference between IBS pains and contractions in terms of location, repetition, and duration. I may not be able to tell the difference between IBS pains and contractions. I may be in labor for a while without realizing it.\nAnswer: Labor contractions are the physical way your uterus tightens to promote delivery of your baby. All body muscles tighten and shorten (contract) when they're being used. And the uterus is one of the strongest muscles in the body. They are often described as feeling like a wave, because their intensity slowly rises, peaks, and then slowly decreases. Labor contractions often radiate from your back to the front of your core, make your whole belly rock hard, feel like cramps, include pelvic pressure include a dull backache. The word commonly associated with contractions is \"pain,\" but you can redirect your mind to think of them as productive, demanding, and just intense. For many people with IBS, their pain can be crippling and disabling. IBS pain can be sharp, stabbing, and intense. People often describe it as if their guts are being twisted by a powerful force. Gas pains and intestinal contractions can make a person double over. The pain can be in the lower back, lower belly, or radiate throughout the body. Many women describe it as being worse than labor pains during childbirth. For some, the pain is so bad that they faint or come close to it."}
{"question": "How will I know it's time to stop pumping my 2-month old?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies do not start eating solid foods at 2 months. There is not an abrupt stop between feeding breast milk and feeding solid foods. The average baby consumes multiple meals throughout the day. Solid food meals can gradually substitute for breast milk. There may be a different recommended age to start adding in solid food meals.\nAnswer: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that mothers feed their babies only breast milk for six months and continue breastfeeding for at least one year. After that, it really depends on how long the mother and child want to continue. Your friends and family may have strong beliefs about when you should stop breastfeeding. But in the end, it's a very personal decision. Only you and your child know what's best for the two of you. After nine to 12 months, your child may decide on her own that she no longer wants to nurse"}
{"question": "How often should I nurse on each breast with a newborn?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are reasons to switch breasts when breastfeeding. There is a recommended length of time to nurse on each breast. There are other ways to ensure that a newborn is getting enough milk. I'm afraid my newborn won't get enough fluids and nutrients.\nAnswer: Every baby is different. How much and how often your baby feeds will depend on your baby's needs. Here are a few things to expect about breastfeeding during the baby's first days, weeks, and months of life. Your newborn baby's belly is tiny. He or she does not need a lot of milk with each feeding to be full, your baby may want to eat as often as every 1 to 3 hours. Frequent feeding helps increase your milk supply and gives your baby practice at sucking and swallowing, you may be able to hear your baby sucking and swallowing the breast milk. As babies grow, their bellies also grow. Your baby will gradually be able to drink more breast milk at each feeding. Newborns may nurse for up to 20 minutes or longer on one or both breasts. As babies get older and more skilled at breastfeeding, they may take about 5-10 minutes on each side. How long it takes to breastfeed depends on you, your baby, and other things, such as whether: your milk supply has come in (this usually happens 2-5 days after birth), your let-down reflex (which causes milk to flow from the nipple) happens right away or after a few minutes into a feeding, your milk flow is slow or fast, the baby has a good latch, taking in as much as possible of your areola (the dark circle of skin around your nipple), your baby begins gulping right away or takes it slow, your baby is sleepy or distracte"}
{"question": "How long is it safe to continue physically-demanding work during pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a specific type of physically-demanding work. The length of time a woman has been doing physically-demanding work may impact safety during pregnancy. Being well-conditioned for physically-demanding work may impact safety during pregnancy. The type of physically-demanding work may impact safety during pregnancy. Physically-demanding work that requires good balance or has a risk of trauma to the abdomen may impact safety during pregnancy.\nAnswer: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, most people are able to continue working while pregnant. That said, the safety of your job depends on factors such as: what you do for a living your health status any complications you may have with your pregnancy. Speak with your doctor if you have concerns about your job or if your employment exposes you to any of the following risks: chemicals, radiation, or other dangerous materials, long periods of standing or climbing, carrying or lifting heavy loads, loud noises or vibrations from heavy machinery, extreme heat or cold. Safe to work or not, you may be feeling all sorts of ways due to early pregnancy symptoms. Here's how you can cope with these on the job. But if you experience pain, cramping, spotting, or any other worrisome symptoms, contact your doctor."}
{"question": "Is it possible to miscalculate your due date based on the first day of your last menstrual period?", "answer": "Reasoning: Knowing the due date is important. The first day of the last menstrual period is used to determine the due date. Different women may have different period lengths and regularity. There are more accurate ways of determining the due date.\nAnswer: For a woman with a regular period, conception typically occurs about 11-21 days after the first day of the last period. Most women do not know the exact date of conception because it can be challenging to know exactly when ovulation occurs. Thus, their conception date is merely an estimate based on the first day of their last period. For women who have irregular menstrual periods or women who cannot remember the first day of their last menstrual period, it can be difficult to determine gestational age using this method. In these cases, an ultrasound exam is often required to determine gestational age. Calculating your due date isn't an exact science and it is possible to miscalculate your due date if mom does not know the first day of their last period or if mom has irregular peroids. Very few women actually deliver on their due date, so, while it's important to have an idea of when your baby will be born, try not to get too attached to the exact date."}
{"question": "How long does it take for a c-section scar to stop hurting?", "answer": "Reasoning: C-section scars may hurt right after surgery and continue to hurt for a week or two. There may be pain medication available to help with the pain of a C-section scar. On average, women may need a certain amount of pain medication for a certain duration after a C-section. Some women may feel pulling, stretching, and itching after the initial pain of a C-section scar has stopped.\nAnswer: At first, your cut (incision) will be raised slightly and pinker than the rest of your skin. It will likely appear somewhat puffy. Any pain should decrease after 2 or 3 days, but your cut will remain tender for up to 3 weeks or more. Most women need pain medicine for the first few days to 2 weeks. Ask your provider what is safe to take while breastfeeding. Over time, your scar will become thinner and flatter and will turn either white or the color of your skin. A C-section incision is a major cut across your abdomen and uterus that's later closed up, usually with stitches. 1 After the surgery, your body will start to undergo the wound-healing process, which will take several weeks and months. Most pain around the C-section incision is resolved after the first few days. However, you may still be sore or tender for a few more weeks."}
{"question": "Is it okay to only pump once a day?", "answer": "Reasoning: The average nursing woman pumps multiple times a day. There may be side effects associated with only pumping once a day. I may not be able to pump enough milk by only pumping once a day. I may not have enough time to pump multiple times a day.\nAnswer: So, during the first few weeks, you should try to pump at least every 2 to 3 hours--about 8 to 12 times each day--to stimulate your body to produce a healthy milk supply. You can stop pumping every three hours when your baby is around 3 months old. As they grow, they will take more at each feeding, but go longer between feedings. If your milk supply is plentiful, you may be able to go longer between pumping sessions, as well. By the time your baby has gained back their birth weight, they may no longer need to be woken at night for a feed. You might want to keep a pumping session right before you go to bed, even if they don't eat at this time. The amount of milk your body makes depends on the number of times your breasts are emptied throughout the day. Draining the breast by pumping often, like your baby would be nursing, will build or maintain a good supply of pumped milk. Most babies breastfeed about eight to 12 times every day. Pumping should closely follow the same pattern as your baby would be breastfeeding. Pump every three hours around the clock or at least eight times in 24 hours until you build a good milk supply. Some moms find it helpful to set an alarm on their phone to remind them it is time to pump."}
{"question": "Can the surgeon or anesthesiologist tell if you are pregnant during surgery?", "answer": "Reasoning: Surgeons and anesthesiologists may not always do pregnancy tests on women of childbearing age prior to surgery. There is a gestational age at which a surgeon may be able to detect pregnancy just by looking at the uterus. Undetected pregnancy during surgery can lead to a miscarriage.\nAnswer: Pregnancy testing may be offered to female sex patients of childbearing age and for whom the result would alter the patient's management, but testing should not be mandatory. Informed consent or assent of the risks, benefits, and alternatives related to preoperative pregnancy testing should ideally be obtained. Best practice may employ shared decision-making between patients and providers. In facilities where an informed consent process is adopted as policy, local policy development should also consider any associated documentation requirements. Preanesthetic educational materials should ideally be developed and given to patients to allow them to make an informed decision. This material should include information about false positives and negatives of pregnancy testing and that the scientific literature is inadequate to inform patients or physicians on whether exposure to anesthesia causes unknown harmful effects during early pregnancy."}
{"question": "How much water should I drink to increase my milk supply?", "answer": "Reasoning: Lactating women may require greater water intake than non-lactating women. Drinking more water may increase milk supply. There is a certain amount of water necessary to increase milk supply. If you don't drink enough water, your breast milk may dry up. Once breast milk dries up, it cannot be regained.\nAnswer: As a nursing mother, you need about 16 cups per day of water, which can come from food, beverages and drinking water, to compensate for the extra water that is used to make milk. One way to help you get the fluids you need is to drink a large glass of water each time you breastfeed your baby. Drink lots of water. It's important to stay hydrated (have fluid in your body) when you're breastfeeding. Drink when you're thirsty. A simple way to make sure you drink enough water is to have a glass each time you breastfeed."}
{"question": "What do contractions feel like and where are they felt during labor?", "answer": "Reasoning: Contractions may not feel similar to a leg cramp. Contractions may start in one part of the abdomen and progress to other parts. Many women may not realize when they are having contractions. If someone can't recognize contractions, they may not realize they are far along in labor.\nAnswer: Labor contractions are the physical way your uterus tightens to promote delivery of your baby. All body muscles tighten and shorten (contract) when they're being used. And the uterus is one of the strongest muscles in the body. They are often described as feeling like a wave, because their intensity slowly rises, peaks, and then slowly decreases. Labor contractions often radiate from your back to the front of your core, make your whole belly rock hard, feel like cramps, include pelvic pressure include a dull backache. The word commonly associated with contractions is \"pain,\" but you can redirect your mind to think of them as productive, demanding, and just intense. A contraction feels different for everyone and might feel different from one pregnancy to the next. Labor contractions cause discomfort or a dull ache in your back and lower abdomen, along with pressure in your pelvis. Some people might also feel pain in their sides and thighs. Some describe contractions as intense menstrual cramps. During a true labor contraction, it might be hard to talk or walk. Labor contractions get more painful and come more frequently as time passes."}
{"question": "How long is considered 'too long' for a newborn to stay in a sitting position?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a limit to how long a newborn should stay in a sitting position. Allowing a newborn to stay in a sitting position for too long can have negative effects. Babies staying in a sitting position for too long can impact their crawling, rolling, and other milestones.\nAnswer: Most newborns do not sit in the sitting position due to their lack of ability to support themselves. Once your baby can raise their chest, help them practice sitting up. Hold them up or support their back with pillows as they learn to balance themselves. They'll soon learn to “tripod,\" which is leaning forward as they extends their arms to balance. Interest­ing toys in front of them will give them a focus as they gains their balance. It will be some time before they can get themselves to a sitting position without your help. But by six to eight months, if you position them upright, they'll stay sitting without leaning forward on their arms."}
{"question": "How to take care of your infant when both you and your partner are sick?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a risk of the baby getting sick if both parents are sick. Normal precautions applied when sick may help protect the baby if both parents are sick. There may be alternative activities that can be done with the baby that don't require close contact. There may need to be changes in how things are done until both parents are better.\nAnswer: If you are sick, you may need to express your milk for use in bottle feedings given by a healthy person. It is unlikely a newborn can catch flu from drinking your breast milk when you are sick. Breast milk is considered safe if you are taking antivirals. Remember when you had a newborn and everyone offered to help? Now's the time to take them up on their offers, says Laurie Ulster. “When you need it, especially when you're sick and your kids are little, ask [for help]"}
{"question": "How warm can my bath be while staying safe for my 4-month-old baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a temperature of water that can burn skin. There is a temperature of water that is safe for a 4-month-old baby. The safe temperature for a baby may be different from that for an adult.\nAnswer: Warm water is best. To prevent scalding, set the thermostat on your water heater to below 120 F (49 C). Always check the water temperature with your hand before bathing your baby. Aim for bath water around 100 F (38 C). Be sure the room is comfortably warm, too. A wet baby can be easily chilled. A safe and comfortable bath temperature for a baby is no higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 degrees Celsius). You can check for the proper temperature with a bath thermometer, which are available widely in the baby section of many stores and online. Test the water by dunking your wrist or elbow into the tub, not just your fingers. Your fingers can handle hotter temperatures, so using your elbow will give you a clearer idea of what the water will feel like for your baby."}
{"question": "Is formula necessary while waiting for milk to come in for most babies?", "answer": "Reasoning: The amount of milk produced by initial breastfeeding may not be sufficient for a newborn. It may be normal for babies to lose weight in the first couple of days after birth. Breast milk may not be enough to feed a baby in the first few days of their life. It may be necessary to supplement with formula while waiting for breast milk to come in.\nAnswer: Colostrum is a thick, rich milk that is high in nutrients. Around day 3 through 5, your milk will come in. Milk supply depends on demand (milk removal.) Feeding frequently, when your baby shows hunger cues, is the best way to have a good supply. If you are having trouble with delayed milk production or a decrease in the amount of milk, then first take a look at the number and length of your feedings. And make sure that your baby is able to put his or her mouth around your nipple to nurse (latch on) and can transfer milk from your breast. Babies who are premature or jaundiced are especially likely to need formula temporarily."}
{"question": "Can my breasts be too large in size for breastfeeding?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breast size may affect milk production. Previous breast augmentation may affect milk production. Women with smaller breasts may produce more milk than those with larger breasts. Breast reduction may increase milk production.\nAnswer: Women of all sizes can successfully breastfeed. So if you're a larger mom-to-be, you should not let the size of your breasts automatically rule it out. If you're big breasted, it may take some extra patience or some help from a lactation consultant . Depending on the size of your breasts, you may need a little more practice to find a breastfeeding hold that works for you and your baby. But with the right help and support, you can do it"}
{"question": "How do I prevent my 7 month old daughter from suffocating while she rolls over in her sleep?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies can suffocate if they get caught in blankets and pillows. There are items that are safe to have in a baby's crib. There are things that can be done to prevent suffocation of a 7 month old. There may be monitors or other devices that can help detect if an infant is suffocating.\nAnswer: Babies who sleep on their backs are much less likely to die suddenly and unexpectedly than babies who sleep on their stomachs or sides. The problem with the side position is that your baby can roll more easily onto their stomach. A firm surface means that it shouldn't indent when your baby is lying on it. Any surface that inclines more than 10 degrees isn't safe for your baby to sleep on. Keep soft objects & loose bedding out of your baby's sleep area. These objects can increase your baby's risk of entrapment, suffocation or strangulation. This includes pillows and pillow-like toys, quilts, comforters, mattress toppers, non-fitted sheets, blankets, toys, bumper pads or related products that attach to crib slats or sides."}
{"question": "How bad is TV for a one-year-old who watches 3-5 hours a day?", "answer": "Reasoning: A one year old should not watch any TV. There is a recommended rate for introducing and increasing TV screen time for children.\nAnswer: Parents are often shocked when I tell them that pediatricians think it's a bad idea for children to watch TV or use mobile apps before age 18 months, because most toddlers already have. Surveys tell us that 92.2% of 1-year-olds have already used a mobile device, some starting as young as age 4 months. What infants and toddlers need most to learn is interaction with the people around them. That doesn't mean that they shouldn't video-chat with a distant grandparent or a deployed parent, but when it comes to day-to-day learning they need to touch things, shake them, throw them, and most of all to see the faces and hear the voices of those they love the most. Apps can teach toddlers to tap and swipe at a screen, but studies tell us that these skills don't translate into real-world learning. \"Screen time\" is a term used for activities done in front of a screen, such as watching TV, working on a computer, or playing video games. Screen time is a sedentary activity, meaning you are being physically inactive while sitting down. Very little energy is used during screen time. Children under age 2 should have no screen time. Limit screen time to 1 to 2 hours a day for children age 2 and over. Despite what ads may say, videos that are aimed at very young children do not improve their development."}
{"question": "How can I tell if my newborn girl is too hot when she's sleeping on me?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are visual and tactile clues that can indicate if a newborn is too hot. There is a way to differentiate between a newborn being a little hot and running a fever. There are effective means to cool down a baby if they are too hot. Harm can come to babies if they overheat. Overheating can lead to a fever.\nAnswer: Use your senses when evaluating whether your baby is overheating. Touch their skin and look for redness in their face as well as signs of discomfort or distress. Keep in mind that some signs of overheating overlap with symptoms of fever or dehydration in your baby. Since young infants may not sweat much in general, your little one may be overheated from their environment without appearing to sweat.; To help you figure out whether baby is overheating, pay attention to whether your little one feels hot (with or without a fever), looks flushed or red, is sweating or has damp hair (though keep in mind that babies can be overheated without sweating), acts fussy or restless, has an elevated heart rate (tachycardia), seems overly tired, sluggish, or listless, appears confused, weak, or dizzy or feels nauseous or is vomiting."}
{"question": "What is the risk of washing the feeding bottle with soap and water instead of boiling?", "answer": "Reasoning: Soap and water may not be as effective as boiling in sterilizing a feeding bottle. There may be a need to both use soap and water and boil the feeding bottle. It may not be necessary to sterilize baby bottles after the first time.\nAnswer: When you first buy bottles, it is important to sterilize them at least one time. After that, it is no longer necessary to sterilize bottles and their accessories. Many years ago, when water supplies were not reliably clean, baby items required sterilization, but nowadays, this is thankfully not an issue. Washing items thoroughly with hot water and soap is all that is required to remove most harmful germs from bottles. If bottles and nipples are labeled \"dishwasher safe,\" you're also in luck -- you can put them directly in the dishwasher, using heated water and a hot drying cycle to clean them. Make sure to take bottles apart during the cleaning process. It is also important to always wash your hands before handling baby bottles or when feeding your baby. Sterilization is an added step that can help kill more germs than traditional cleaning. It provides extra protection against germs but is not necessary for healthy infants who have access to clean water sources and strong immune systems."}
{"question": "Are visual hallucinations a normal pregnancy symptom?", "answer": "Reasoning: Many women experience visual hallucinations during pregnancy. The incidence of visual hallucinations may vary depending on gestational age. There may be some serious causes for visual hallucinations during pregnancy. Visual hallucinations during pregnancy may not be dangerous.\nAnswer: No, visual hallucinations are normally associated with a condition called Eclampsia, which is a condition caused by pregnancy. The initial manifestations of this illness are called pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia arises at about the 20th week of pregnancy and is characterized by hypertension (high blood pressure), edema (tissue swelling due to the movement of fluid out of blood vessels), and proteinuria (an excessive accumulation of protein in the urine). When a pre-eclamptic patient develops neurologic symptoms, the condition is referred to as eclampsia. Eclampsia is usually characterized by seizures, but can also present as blindness, visual hallucinations, or even coma."}
{"question": "How safe are dental X-rays during pregnancy?", "answer": "Reasoning: Radiation from dental X-rays can potentially harm an unborn baby. The abdomen is exposed to radiation during dental X-rays. Using a lead shield can decrease radiation exposure from X-rays. There may be a benefit to delaying dental X-rays until after delivery if possible.\nAnswer: According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, x-rays are generally safe during pregnancy, but there is quite a bit of controversy surrounding this issue. Studies have been conflicting and, therefore, x-rays should only be done when the benefits outweigh the risks. X-rays can give your health care provider important and even life-saving information about numerous medical conditions. Like many things, x-rays can have risks as well as benefits. ; The possibility of an X-ray during pregnancy causing harm to your unborn child is very small. Generally, the benefits of the diagnostic information from an X-ray outweigh the potential risk to a baby. However, if you received a large number of abdominal X-rays over a short period before you were aware of your pregnancy, your baby could be affected. Most X-ray exams -- including those of the legs, head, teeth or chest -- won't expose your reproductive organs to the direct X-ray beam, and a lead apron can be worn to provide protection from radiation scatter. The exception is abdominal X-rays, which expose your belly -- and your baby -- to the direct X-ray beam. The risk of harm to your baby depends on your baby's gestational age and the amount of radiation exposure. Exposure to extremely high-dose radiation in the first two weeks after conception might result in a miscarriage. However, these dose levels aren't used in diagnostic imaging."}
{"question": "At what age is it considered safe to cosleep without precautions?", "answer": "Reasoning: Cosleeping can be beneficial for both baby and mother. There are precautions that need to be taken when cosleeping with a baby. There are potential dangers associated with cosleeping. There is an age at which the potential dangers of cosleeping subside.\nAnswer: This is when a parent and child sleep in close social or physical contact of each other, meaning that each can tell that the other is nearby. Avoid co-sleeping with infants who are at greatest risk of SIDs. This includes those younger than 4 months, preterm babies, and those who had a low birth weight. Under the age of 12 months, there should be absolutely no bed-sharing. The AAP updated their sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) guidelines in 2016 to recommend room-sharing for the baby's first year, but to avoid bed-sharing due to accidental suffocation risks. Learn more about these guidelines and how to reduce your baby's SIDS risk."}
{"question": "Why did the hospital give my newborn formula when they were born?", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be reasons why a new mother is unable to breastfeed right after delivery. The hospital may not ask for permission before feeding a baby formula. A baby may still be able to breastfeed after being fed formula. Giving a newborn formula does not necessarily mean they won't want to or be able to breastfeed. There may be situations where a hospital chooses to give a newborn formula.\nAnswer: The top three most common reasons for in‐hospital infant formula supplementation reported by hospital staff include medical indications; maternal request/preference/feelings; lactation management‐related issues; physical but non‐medically indicated reasons etc. A reason your baby was given formula could be your perceived low milk supply, which is a common lactation management concern that has frequently been reported by studies."}
{"question": "Why is it difficult to lose weight while breastfeeding?", "answer": "Reasoning: Engorged breasts may contribute to weight gain or difficulty losing weight while breastfeeding. Restricting calories while breastfeeding may be desirable and not affect milk production, calories, or nutrients. Women may tend to gain or lose weight while breastfeeding. There are extra calories burned during breastfeeding. Breastfeeding may not be the only factor that contributes to weight postpartum.\nAnswer: A deficit of 500 calories per day may theoretically help breastfeeding mothers lose around 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week for a total of about 4 pounds (1.8 kg) per month. Therefore, breastfeeding mothers who gained the recommended 25-35 pounds (11.5-16 kg) during pregnancy should be able to lose this weight within the first 6-8 months postpartum .However, many nursing mothers take longer than this interval to shed their baby weight. In fact, research shows that many women only lose up to 86% of the weight gained during pregnancy within the first 6 months after giving birth. What's more, some studies find no difference in weight loss between breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding mothers altogether. The reasons why some women may have a harder time losing their baby weight while breastfeeding can be diverse. For one, breastfeeding tends to increase hunger. Studies show that some women eat more and move less while nursing -- compensating for the extra calorie burn of breastfeeding."}
{"question": "Is NIPT gender ever inaccurate?", "answer": "Reasoning: NIPT gender tests exist. There is a documented accuracy rate for these tests. There are factors that can cause an inaccurate NIPT gender test.\nAnswer: NIPT tests (noninvasive prenatal testing test) use a pregnant person's blood to detect congenital abnormalities in the fetus's DNA. The DNA is examined for genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome. NIPT tests don't diagnose conditions. The accuracy of the test varies by the condition that it's checking for. Other factors -- like being pregnant with multiples, being a surrogate or having obesity -- can affect NIPT results. NIPT is about 99% accurate in detecting Down syndrome. The test is slightly less accurate for detecting trisomy 18 and 13. Overall, NIPT tests produce fewer false positives than other prenatal screenings like the quad screen. NIPT has a very high sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) for Down syndrome. For other conditions such as Edwards and Patau syndrome, the sensitivity is slightly lower but still strong. It's important to reiterate, however, that the test is not 100 percent accurate or diagnostic. False positive NIPT screening results can happen as well. If you have a positive NIPT result, your healthcare provider will likely order additional diagnostic tests. In some cases, these diagnostic tests reveal that the baby doesn't have a chromosomal abnormality after all."}
{"question": "How do you emotionally handle stopping breastfeeding unexpectedly?", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be reasons why women feel emotional when they stop breastfeeding. These feelings may be considered normal. It may be possible to replace sad feelings about stopping breastfeeding with positive feelings of anticipation for the next phase. Most women become very sad upon stopping breastfeeding. There are chemicals in breast milk that promote emotional wellbeing.\nAnswer: For mothers, weaning sometimes brings feelings of sadness, especially if you need to wean your baby abruptly. Even mothers who feel ready for weaning may feel a sense of loss. Support and encouragement are important during this time. Extra physical contact and affection with your baby helps to compensate for the loss of the closeness of nursing. Even for those who are happy to be done breastfeeding or pumping, the days after weaning can be an emotional time. Some mamas feel tearful, sad or mildly depressed after their baby is done nursing. Others may feel irritable, anxious or moody. Many feel a mix of emotions, such as relief, grief, and sadness about the loss of connection and those sweet feeding time snuggles. Though the depression can pass after your hormones return to normal, post-weaning depression can become serious. A health-care professional can help you manage your mental health so you can feel like yourself again."}
{"question": "Can I make formula with chlorinated water for my newborn?", "answer": "Reasoning: Using chlorinated water for a newborn may have serious side effects. There may be easily accessible ways to get dechlorinated water for making formula. I may not have access to nonchlorinated water.\nAnswer: No, If your baby drinks only concentrated or powder formula, you might switch between fluoridated tap water and low-fluoride bottled water. Labels on these bottles will say: Deionized, Purified, Demineralized, Distilled."}
{"question": "What is the maximum weight I can carry in the second trimester?", "answer": "Reasoning: Carrying a heavy weight may have an impact on my child or myself. There may be potential dangers associated with carrying too much weight in the second trimester.\nAnswer: If you start at a health weight, you should gain 5-15 pounds in your second trimester.

{"question": "where does implantation and formation of the placenta normally occur", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a process by which the uterine lining prepares for implantation. There is a specific place in the uterine lining where implantation normally occurs. There is a process by which the placenta develops. Pregnancies can attach to specific places in the uterus. Miscarriages may occur if the pregnancy attaches to the wrong place.\nAnswer: During fertilization, the sperm and egg unite in one of the fallopian tubes to form a zygote. Then the zygote travels down the fallopian tube, where it becomes a morula. Once it reaches the uterus, the morula becomes a blastocyst. The blastocyst then burrows into the uterine wall — a process called implantation.  The placenta develops shortly after conception and attaches to the wall of your uterus."}
{"question": "which of the following are methods that could identify a genetic disorder in a fetus", "answer": "Reasoning: Genetic disorders can be identified prior to birth. There are different tests available to identify a genetic disorder. The timing of the tests during pregnancy can affect their ability to identify a genetic disorder. Ultrasound alone may not be sufficient to identify a genetic disorder. Further testing may be necessary to identify a genetic disorder. Having no family history of genetic disorders may lower the risk of having one.\nAnswer: With amniocentesis, the doctor inserts a thin needle through the pregnant woman's abdominal wall into the uterus. A small sample of amniotic fluid is taken from the sac surrounding the fetus. When the fluid is analyzed in the laboratory, it can check for serious genetic and chromosomal disorders, such as Down syndrome​. With chorionic villus sampling (CVS), a long, slender needle is inserted through the abdomen to remove a small sample of cells (called chorionic villi) from the placenta. Or a catheter (a thin plastic tube) is placed into the vagina and then inserted through the cervix to take cells from the placenta. This sample is then analyzed in the laboratory. During pregnancy, some of the baby's genetic information (DNA) crosses into the mother's bloodstream. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) analyzes this DNA to check if the baby has a higher chance of having certain chromosomal disorders. A blood sample is taken from the mother (not from the baby) usually after the tenth week of pregnancy."}
{"question": "what is one of the risks associated with the water birthing technique", "answer": "Reasoning: Water birthing is a technique that exists. There are some risks associated with water birthing. There are ways to minimize the risks of water birthing.\nAnswer: Pediatricians are most concerned with the potential risk of aspiration, hypothermia, and infection when babies are born in water. An understanding of these mechanisms is important to appraise the safety of water birth. It is also important to have knowledge of the triggers for newborn breathing and what takes place in the cardiovascular system as the baby transitions from fetal circulation to newborn circulation."}
{"question": "when does beta hcg become positive in urine", "answer": "Reasoning: Beta hCG is a substance that can be detected in the body. There are tests available to detect beta hCG. Beta hCG can be detected in both blood and urine. There is a specific time frame in which beta hCG can be detected in the body.\nAnswer: For many tests, HCG can be detected in your urine about 10 days after conception. However, taking it after you miss your period reduces the chance of getting a false-negative result. A missed period typically happens around 14 days after conception."}
{"question": "what does code pink mean in labor and delivery", "answer": "Reasoning: Code pink in the U.S. means a young baby is having a serious medical emergency. There may be different hospital codes in different hospitals or states. There is no specific code for when a baby is abducted.\nAnswer: A code pink is a widely accepted emergency code to alert staff that an infant or child is missing or has been abducted.  Nursing will notify the hospital and advise to announce “Code Pink” when an infant/child is discovered to be missing"}
{"question": "what are the chances of a baby surviving a tubal pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be differences between the lining of the fallopian tube and the lining of the uterus. It is possible for a pregnancy to successfully implant and grow in the fallopian tube. There may be risks to the mother associated with a tubal pregnancy. Babies cannot grow to full term in the fallopian tube. Removing a tubal pregnancy is not the same as an abortion.\nAnswer: An embryo implanted outside the uterus has virtually no chance of surviving to birth. In a few rare instances, we have seen embryos grow for 12 to 13 weeks before they die due to insufficient hormone and nutrition supply"}
{"question": "when is a baby considered small for gestational age", "answer": "Reasoning: The growth rate and size of a baby in utero can be determined. There is a standard used to determine if a baby is small, appropriate, or large for gestational age. There is a cutoff for what is considered small for gestational age. Small for gestational age pregnancies may be more likely to result in miscarriage. An early ultrasound is important for diagnosing small for gestational age.\nAnswer: Small for gestational age (SGA) is defined as a birth weight of less than 10th percentile for gestational age.SGA infants are categorized into two major groups: constitutionally normal infants who are SGA and infants who are SGA because of growth restriction with a birth weight lower than expected optimal birth weight. The constitutionally normal infants have normal birth weight less than 10th percentile because of inherent factors such as maternal height, weight, ethnicity, parity, and in these infants, there is no increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity."}
{"question": "when can a baby be delivered and survive", "answer": "Reasoning: The general gestational age at which a baby can be viable outside of the uterus is a factor in determining survival. Gestational age is not the only factor that determines viability outside of the uterus. There may be ongoing problems that a baby could have after early preterm delivery. The earliest a baby can be delivered and survive is around 23-24 weeks. The later a baby is born, the better. A baby can stay in the womb too long.\nAnswer: In general, infants that are born very early are not considered to be viable until after 24 weeks gestation. This means that if you give birth to an infant before they are 24 weeks old, their chance of surviving is usually less than 50 percent Some infants are born before 24 weeks gestation and do survive. But these infants have a very high chance of severe long-term health problems. About 40 percent of these preemies will suffer long-term health complications because they were born prematurely. The survival rate for 24-week-old infants is between 60 and 70 percent.  But, a 24-week old preemie's chance of dying goes down dramatically if a woman can stay pregnant for just two or three weeks longer. The preemie's chances of having long-term health problems also decrease dramatically."}
{"question": "why can't a baby come out feet first", "answer": "Reasoning: There are different ways a baby can present during a vaginal delivery. It is better for a baby to come out head first rather than feet first. It is possible for a baby to be delivered feet first.\nAnswer: The position of the baby's head matters for delivery. During birth, the baby's head pushes through the vaginal canal, widening it and making it possible for the rest of the body to follow more easily. If the baby's buttocks or feet lead the way, labor can become more difficult and dangerous. Dangers of a vaginal breech birth include cord prolapse (a rare emergency when the umbilical cord exits the cervical opening first), traumatic injury such as a dislocated shoulder, or reduced oxygen if the head cannot pass through the canal after the rest of the body quickly enough. To avoid these risks, your OBGYN may recommend turning the baby to the head down position with an external, manual manipulation called external cephalic version (ECV). If that doesn't work or your baby remains in the breech position at week 39 gestation, your OBGYN will recommend a C-section as the safest birth option"}
{"question": "what is the fossa ovalis called in the fetal heart", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a structure in the fetal heart called the fossa ovalis. The fossa ovalis is formed prior to birth. The fossa ovalis is the result of a hole in the heart closing. If the hole does not close, surgery may be required.\nAnswer: The fossa ovalis is a depressed structure, of varying shapes, located in the inferior aspect of the right interatrial septum. [1] A remnant of an interatrial opening, the foramen ovale, which has a significant role in fetal circulation, the fossa ovalis forms by the fusion of the septum primum and septum secundum."}
{"question": "what hormone keeps the lining thick once the ovum has been released", "answer": "Reasoning: Estrogen is the hormone that keeps the lining thick once the ovum has been released. Taking estrogen pills can help keep the ovum healthy for the implanting pregnancy. The ovum is released from a specific site. There are other hormones released from the site where the ovum was released and they have specific functions.\nAnswer: The luteal phase causes the lining of the uterus to thicken in preparation for pregnancy. If a fertilised egg implants in the lining of the uterus, the corpus luteum continues to produce progesterone, which maintains the thickened lining of the uterus."}
{"question": "what should mother's do when they discover that they have the zika virus", "answer": "Reasoning: The Zika virus is a specific concern in pregnant women. There is a way to treat infection with the Zika virus. There is a need for monitoring the fetus of women infected with the Zika virus. The Zika virus is dangerous in pregnancy. The baby may be fine if the Zika virus is treated early enough.\nAnswer: If you are pregnant, you should tell your doctor or other health care provider if you recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika or had sex without a condom with someone who lives in or recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika. If you develop symptoms of Zika (fever, rash, joint pain, red eyes or muscle pain), your health care provider may order blood or urine tests to look for Zika or other viruses like dengue or chikungunya. If you live in or recently traveled to an area with risk of Zika outside the U.S. and its territories, your doctor may consider testing for Zika even if you do not have symptoms of Zika."}
{"question": "when does a woman start menstruation after giving birth", "answer": "Reasoning: There are different factors that determine when menstruation starts after giving birth. The timing of menstruation after giving birth may vary depending on whether or not a woman is breastfeeding. If a woman does not start her period after giving birth, it may be a sign that she is pregnant again.\nAnswer: Your first period can come anytime between two and 12 weeks after delivery. For most women, it happens between six and 12 weeks. If you exclusively breastfeed, your period will likely be delayed until you give your baby solid food and other forms of milk."}
{"question": "how do they remove the umbilical cord from the mother", "answer": "Reasoning: The umbilical cord needs to be actively removed from the mother. There is a potential risk of infection if the umbilical cord is not taken out. The umbilical cord is connected to something. After the umbilical cord is cut on the baby side, there is still more of it that needs to be removed.\nAnswer: The third stage of labour is when your placenta and the bag that held your baby and the amniotic fluid (the membranes) are delivered. In most hospital units, the third stage is ‘actively managed' because it is known that women who opt to have this are at less risk of significant blood loss at delivery. However, you may choose a physiological, ‘unaided' third stage.During an actively managed third stage: you'll have an injection to reduce the size of your womb, your midwife will clamp and cut the umbilical cord, and you'll deliver the placenta with or without the help of your midwife. At this stage, you may be able to push the placenta out. But it's more likely your midwife will help deliver it by putting a hand on your tummy to protect your womb and keeping the cord pulled tight. This is called cord traction."}
{"question": "how long does the average woman breast feed", "answer": "Reasoning: Most women breastfeed for a range of time. There is an average length of time that women breastfeed. There are factors that influence how long women decide to breastfeed. More prolonged breastfeeding may be better for the health of the mother and the baby.\nAnswer: 58% of women breastfeed, either exclusively or with formula, for the first six months after birth. By 12 months, this drops down to 38%"}
{"question": "when does the uterus become a pelvic organ in pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: The uterus is normally not in the pelvis in a nonpregnant person. The uterus is normally higher up in the abdomen in a nonpregnant person. The uterus becomes a pelvic organ in pregnancy. The uterus is in the pelvis in a full-term pregnancy.\nAnswer: Your uterus is developed when you are a fetus, around 10 weeks. You are born with your uterus.. In pregnancy, the uterus increases in size to accommodate the developing fetus. At approximately 12 weeks gestation the uterus becomes large enough to be palpable just above the pubic symphysis."}
{"question": "when do babies start breathing theough their mouth", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies typically breathe through their nose. There is an age at which babies can breathe through either their nose or their mouth. There can be issues that arise from a baby's typical breathing before they can breathe through either their nose or mouth. Babies can have serious trouble breathing if their noses become clogged before a certain age.\nAnswer: Babies only breathe through their nose for the first few months. It is normal for a newborn to have periods of irregular breathing. Your baby may snort or even have a brief pause in breathing while sleeping. Your baby's breathing pattern will become more regular in about a month or two."}
{"question": "when does the first stage of labor begin", "answer": "Reasoning: There are multiple stages of labor. The first stage of labor has a specific start and end time. The onset of true labor can be determined.\nAnswer: The first stage of labor and birth occurs when you begin to feel persistent contractions. These contractions become stronger, more regular and more frequent over time. They cause the cervix to open (dilate) and soften as well as shorten and thin (efface) to allow your baby to move into the birth canal. The first stage is the longest of the three stages. It's actually divided into two phases — early labor and active labor.  Early labor is unpredictable. For first-time moms, the average length varies from hours to days. It's often shorter for subsequent deliveries."}
{"question": "how does an embryo get food during its development in the egg", "answer": "Reasoning: The early embryo gets nutrients from the yolk sac. After the early embryonic stage, the embryo gets nutrients from the placenta.\nAnswer: Special temporary organs or embryonic membranes are formed within the egg, both to protect the embryo and to provide for its nutrition, respiration and excretion. These organs include the yolk sac, amnion and allantois. The yolk sac supplies food material to the embryo."}
{"question": "which hormone causes follicles to release their eggs for fertilization", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a hormone released by the brain that causes the release of eggs for fertilization. Birth control pills work by blocking this hormone. There are multiple hormones that control ovulation. One of the hormones is responsible for follicular growth. One of the hormones is responsible for the release of an egg during ovulation.\nAnswer: Leutinizing hormone (LH), the other reproductive pituitary hormone, aids in egg maturation and provides the hormonal trigger to cause ovulation and the release of eggs from the ovary."}
{"question": "when do many obstetricians date the onset of pregnancy from", "answer": "Reasoning: Most obstetricians use the first day of the last period to date the onset of pregnancy. The method of using the first day of the last period is only an approximation of the actual beginning of pregnancy. It may not be possible to determine the exact date of onset of pregnancy. There are different methods used to estimate the date of onset of pregnancy. There may be a more accurate way to date a pregnancy.\nAnswer: Pregnancy (or gestation) is calculated as 40 weeks and starts from the first day of your last menstrual period. Pregnancy is classified into 3 stages known as trimesters."}
{"question": "when does the uterine lining become more vascular", "answer": "Reasoning: The uterine lining becomes more vascular after the embryo implants. This is why most women don't bleed in early pregnancy. New vessels start to grow in the uterine lining (endometrium). The endometrial vessels branch out, grow longer, and mature.\nAnswer: New vessel growth within the endometrium is initiated during the follicular phase; while angiogenesis in the forms of branching, elongation, and vascular maturation occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle"}
{"question": "what is the meaning of vertex presentation in pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: Vertex presentation means the baby is head down. There are different presentations that a baby can be in during pregnancy. A baby's presentation can change throughout pregnancy. There may be a preferred presentation as labor approaches.\nAnswer: A vertex presentation is the ideal position for a fetus to be in for a vaginal delivery. It means the fetus is head down, headfirst and facing your spine with its chin tucked to its chest. Vertex presentation describes a fetus being head-first or head down in the birth canal."}
{"question": "when do babies become able to distinguish different speech sounds", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies start to be able to distinguish different speech sounds around 4-5 months. Distinguishing different speech sounds is the first step to understanding and speaking language. There is a normal age range during which babies start to be able to distinguish speech sounds.\nAnswer: Newborns also begin to recognize important sounds in their environment, such as the voice of their mother or primary caretaker. As they grow, babies begin to sort out the speech sounds that compose the words of their language. By 6 months of age, most babies recognize the basic sounds of their native language."}
{"question": "when do females start showing signs of pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: Women can show signs of pregnancy before the second trimester. There are signs that can indicate a woman is pregnant. Some signs of pregnancy tend to show up earlier than others. There may be some signs that are more reliable indicators of pregnancy. There may be factors that can make detection of these signs more difficult.\nAnswer: According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, most women (59 percent) experienced an onset of pregnancy symptoms by their fifth or sixth week, while 71 percent reported symptoms by the end of week six and 89 percent by week eight. If you don't feel any symptoms at all, don't worry!"}
{"question": "when is a baby said to be premature", "answer": "Reasoning: A baby is considered premature if born before a certain age cutoff. There is a difference between prematurity and extreme prematurity. A baby is not considered full term until a certain gestational age. A baby is considered mature at a certain gestational age.\nAnswer: A premature birth means a baby is born too early. The birth takes place before the 37th week of pregnancy. A typical pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. Premature babies often have serious health problems, especially when they're born very early. These problems often vary. But the earlier a baby is born, the higher the risk of health challenges."}
{"question": "how to cure breast wound due to breastfeeding", "answer": "Reasoning: Breast wounds can be caused by breastfeeding. There are at-home remedies for treating breastfeeding-related breast wounds. It is possible to continue breastfeeding while treating breast wounds. There may be do-it-yourself or over-the-counter treatments for breastfeeding-related breast wounds. There may be prescription treatments for breastfeeding-related breast wounds.\nAnswer: Healing nipple fissures often involves implementing proper nursing techniques. Getting your baby to latch onto your breast with a full mouth encircling the dark tissue surrounding your nipple (areola) can ease pressure on the nipple itself. An asymmetrical latch protects the nipple. A lactation consultant can show you how. Applying small amounts of Lanolin, Purslane cream, diluted peppermint oil or Menthol essence on your nipples can soothe nipple pain from fissures and encourage healing. Wipe off any antiseptic creams or lotions before you nurse. Using creams and ointments while allowing your nipples to air dry can promote healing while keeping your nipples from getting overly moist. Overly moist nipples are prone to tear. Wear bras with pads made out of breathable fabric. Consider going topless when possible."}
{"question": "when does the heart form in a fetus", "answer": "Reasoning: The circulatory system is one of the first systems to form in a fetus. Fetal heart development begins at a certain point in pregnancy. A fully formed heart can be visible on ultrasound at a certain stage of pregnancy.\nAnswer: At the end of the 4th week of gestation, the heartbeats of the embryo begin. The heart, whose development starts at the 3rd week of gestation, has rapid and irregular contractions capable of pumping the blood inside the vessels."}
{"question": "how does a cyst form in the ovaries", "answer": "Reasoning: Cysts form in the ovaries where eggs are produced. There are different types of ovarian cysts. Not all ovarian cysts form for the same reasons. There are common ovarian cysts and they form in specific ways.\nAnswer: The follicle contains fluid that protects the egg as it grows, and it bursts when the egg is released. But sometimes a follicle does not release an egg, or does not discharge its fluid and shrink after the egg is released. If this happens, the follicle can swell and become a cyst."}
{"question": "what is the normal range of afi in pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a measurement called AFI in pregnancy. There is a normal range of AFI. The normal range of AFI may vary throughout pregnancy.\nAnswer: A normal amniotic fluid index is 5 cm to 25 cm using the standard assessment method. Less than 5 cm is considered oligohydramnios, and greater than 25 cm is considered polyhydramnios."}
{"question": "when does the heart develop in a human fetus", "answer": "Reasoning: The heart develops in the second trimester of pregnancy. The first system to form in a fetus is the cardiovascular system. A pumping heart and circulation can be detected in a fetus at a certain point in development.\nAnswer: At the end of the 4th week of gestation, the heartbeats of the embryo begin. The heart, whose development starts at the 3rd week of gestation, has rapid and irregular contractions capable of pumping the blood inside the vessels."}
{"question": "where does the umbilical cord connect to inside the baby", "answer": "Reasoning: The umbilical cord serves a purpose for the baby. The umbilical cord is more of a continuation rather than just a connection. The umbilical cord carries blood vessels that continue beyond the umbilical cord to large fetal vessels.\nAnswer: The umbilical cord enters the fetus via the abdomen, at the point which (after separation) will become the umbilicus (belly button or navel). Within the fetus, the umbilical vein continues towards the transverse fissure of the liver, where it splits into two."}
{"question": "what would cause hearing loss in a child", "answer": "Reasoning: There are major causes of hearing loss in a child. There is a way to detect hearing loss in a child. It may be possible to detect hearing loss in a very young child.\nAnswer: Acquired hearing loss can be the result of head trauma, illness, exposure to loud noises, or certain medical treatments. Hearing loss can be either temporary or permanent."}
{"question": "when does fundal height correlate with gestational age", "answer": "Reasoning: Fundal height is a measurement taken during pregnancy. OBs and midwives start measuring fundal heights at a certain point in pregnancy. Fundal height correlates with gestational age around 20 weeks. Fundal height continues to correlate with gestational age throughout the rest of the pregnancy.\nAnswer: The expectation is that after week 24 of pregnancy the fundal height for a normally growing baby will match the number of weeks of pregnancy — plus or minus 2 centimeters. For example, if you're 27 weeks pregnant, your health care provider would expect your fundal height to be about 27 centimeters."}
{"question": "what does it mean when a baby is born en caul", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies born en caul have special characteristics or abilities. En caul births are rare. There is a difference between an en caul birth and a birth that is not en caul. An en caul birth does not necessarily mean there is something wrong with the baby. There may be some potential risks associated with an en caul birth.\nAnswer: En caul is a term used to describe the birth of a fetus and placenta entirely encased in an un-ruptured amniotic sac. Also colloquially referred to as a “mermaid” or “veiled” delivery, en caul births are uncommon in obstetrics literature and, therefore, exceedingly rare in the emergency department."}
{"question": "how to calculate gestational age from crown-rump length", "answer": "Reasoning: Crown-rump length can be measured during an ultrasound. There is a gestational age up to which crown-rump length can be measured. Crown-rump length can be used to determine gestational age. The first day of the last period is considered a more accurate way to determine gestational age.\nAnswer: Gestation by CRL is calculated: Weeks = 5.2876 + (0.1584 * Crown_Rump_Length) - (0.0007 * Crown_Rump_Length2). This will be gestation at time of ultrasound. by your physician."}
{"question": "when do babies start to have stranger anxiety", "answer": "Reasoning: Stranger anxiety starts at a certain point in a baby's development. There is a purpose for stranger anxiety. Stranger anxiety typically goes away at a certain point. Not all babies experience stranger anxiety.\nAnswer: Stranger anxiety is manifested by crying when an unfamiliar person approaches. It is normal when it starts at about 8 to 9 months and usually abates by age 2 years. Stranger anxiety is linked with the infant's developmental task of distinguishing the familiar from the unfamiliar."}
{"question": "when a baby is born with a veil", "answer": "Reasoning: Being born with a veil is different from a regular birth. There is a meaning or significance to being born with a veil. There may be some potential dangers associated with being born with a veil.\nAnswer: En caul is a term used to describe the birth of a fetus and placenta entirely encased in an un-ruptured amniotic sac, also known as a \"veil birth\". Also colloquially referred to as a “mermaid” or “veiled” delivery, en caul births are uncommon in obstetrics literature and, therefore, exceedingly rare in the emergency department."}
{"question": "when are babies no longer obligate nose breathers", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies are obligate nose breathers when they are first born. There may be problems associated with obligate nose breathing. Babies learn to breathe through their mouths at some point. Babies may not remain obligate nose breathers until they are 1 year old. There may be a need to train babies to breathe out of their mouths.\nAnswer: Babies only breathe through their nose for the first few months. It is normal for a newborn to have periods of irregular breathing. Your baby may snort or even have a brief pause in breathing while sleeping. Your baby's breathing pattern will become more regular in about a month or two."}
{"question": "when do neural tube defects occur during pregnancy", "answer": "Reasoning: The spinal cord and nervous system develop in a baby at a certain time during pregnancy. There are different types of neural tube defects. There are certain occurrences that can cause neural tube defects. Neural tube defects occur during the first month of pregnancy. It is important to take precautions to prevent neural tube defects if planning to get pregnant. Taking the right vitamins is one of the precautions to prevent neural tube defects.\nAnswer: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are birth defects of the brain, spine or spinal cord that happen in fetuses within the first month of pregnancy. NTDs are linked to folate (folic acid) deficiency before and during pregnancy, so it's important to make sure you're getting enough folate through supplements and in your diet before and during pregnancy."}
{"question": "when might fundal height in a pregnant woman most accurately predict gestational age", "answer": "Reasoning: Fundal height is a measurement used to predict gestational age. Fundal height can be measured starting in the late first trimester. Fundal height is accurate as soon as the uterus can be felt through the stomach. Fundal height can be used to predict gestational age throughout the entire pregnancy.\nAnswer: The expectation is that after week 24 of pregnancy the fundal height for a normally growing baby will match the number of weeks of pregnancy — plus or minus 2 centimeters. For example, if you're 27 weeks pregnant, your health care provider would expect your fundal height to be about 27 centimeters."}
{"question": "when does the embryo attach to the womb", "answer": "Reasoning: The embryo enters the uterus after fertilization. The embryo attaches to the uterine wall after entering the uterus. There is a specific part of the uterine wall that the embryo attaches to. The embryo quickly develops the placenta after attaching to the uterine wall.\nAnswer: During fertilization, the sperm and egg unite in one of the fallopian tubes to form a zygote. Then the zygote travels down the fallopian tube, where it becomes a morula. Once it reaches the uterus, the morula becomes a blastocyst. Once the embryo reaches the blastocyst stage, approximately five to six days after fertilization, it hatches out of its zona pellucida and begins the process of implantation in the uterus.  The placenta develops shortly after conception and attaches to the wall of your uterus."}
{"question": "Should I get the whooping cough vaccine while pregnant?", "answer": "Reasoning: The whooping cough vaccine may have potential risks or side effects during pregnancy. The whooping cough vaccine may pose a risk to the fetus. The whooping cough vaccine may be beneficial to the mother and fetus. There are potential risks associated with getting the whooping cough vaccine during pregnancy. There may be specific trimesters during which it is recommended to receive the whooping cough vaccine. The whooping cough vaccine may be effective in preventing the transmission of the infection to newborns. There is a recommended interval between receiving the whooping cough vaccine and the expected delivery date. Health authorities and organizations provide guidelines and recommendations regarding the whooping cough vaccine for pregnant women.\nAnswer: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend several vaccines for pregnant women, and the benefits don't just work in mom's favor: when you are pregnant, you can share antibodies against diseases with your baby. Currently, the CDC recommends the Tdap and Flu vaccine for moms-to-be. Tdap stands for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine. Pertussis is another name for the whooping cough. While you are pregnant you should not receive live virus vaccines, like MMR and chickenpox."}
{"question": "Is it okay to move my baby out of my bedroom before 6 months?", "answer": "Reasoning: Keeping the baby in the bedroom is a universally recommended practice. There is a timeframe for when it's considered safe to move the baby out of the bedroom. The baby's sleep environment outside the parents' bedroom might be less safe. There is a standard and optimal duration for room-sharing with the baby for the first six months. Moving the baby out of the bedroom earlier than six months might negatively impact the baby's sleep or development. There are recommended guidelines for baby sleeping arrangements during the first six months. There may be specific benefits associated with keeping a baby in the parent's bedroom for the first six months. There are factors that should be considered when deciding to move a baby out of the parents' bedroom before six months. There may be potential risks or drawbacks to moving a baby out of the parents' bedroom before the age of six months. The baby's developmental stage and sleep patterns may influence the decision to move them out of the parents' bedroom.\nAnswer: The American Academy of Pediatrics has a list of safe sleep recommendations all parents and parents -to-be should become familiar with. These recommendations are in place to protect infants against Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID), which includes Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Some important topics include placing baby only on their back to sleep, putting baby to sleep in their own crib/bassinet/portable play yard with a firm, flat mattress and a fitted sheet, keep all items out of sleep space, breastfeed if possible, and avoid smoking. They recommend baby share the same room as it's parents for the first six months, as well."}
{"question": "Should I lay my 4-month-old baby down on his stomach for naps even though he hasn't rolled over yet?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are recommended sleep positions for infants. Tummy time has benefits for a baby's development. There may be specific circumstances when it is safe to place a baby on their stomach for naps. There are signs that indicate a baby is ready to start sleeping on their stomach. There may be alternative sleep strategies or positions recommended for infants who haven't rolled over yet. Putting the baby on their stomach for naps might improve sleep quality. Placing the baby on their stomach could encourage earlier rolling over. The baby's discomfort or fussiness during sleep might be alleviated by a stomach sleeping position. Stomach sleeping may help my baby sleep better. There may be a risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) if I lay my baby on his stomach. Stomach sleeping may pose immediate or long-term health risks for my baby.\nAnswer: Sleep-related infant death information was updated in 2022 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Their number one recommendation remains to back to sleep for every sleep. Other recommendations include a firm, flat, and non-inclined sleep surface, feeding of human milk (which is associated with a reduced risk of SIDS), keeping soft objects out of sleep area, and sleeping in the parents' room. They have many more recommendations for safe sleep, and all new parents should familiarize themselves with these guidelines."}
{"question": "How much formula is too much for my 4-week-old baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: All babies do not have the same nutritional needs. There may be a recommended daily intake of formula for a 4-week-old baby. There may be a recommended feeding schedule for a 4-week-old baby. There may be signs that a 4-week-old baby is getting too much formula. Factors such as weight or growth rate may influence the appropriate amount of formula for a 4-week-old baby. Overfeeding with formula may lead to health issues in a 4-week-old baby.\nAnswer: On average, newborns drink about 1.5-3 ounces every 2-3 hours. By the time they are two months old, this has increased to 4-5 ounces every 3-4 hours. It is important to pay attention to both hunger and satiety (fullness) cues from baby. Some ways your baby may tell you they are full is sucking less enthusiastically, turning their head away from the bottle, closing their mouth, and stop sucking."}
{"question": "Is it harmful for my baby's ears if I vacuum while wearing her?", "answer": "Reasoning: Loud sounds could potentially harm a baby's ears. The noise level generated by a vacuum cleaner may be loud enough to pose a risk to a baby's hearing. A baby's ears are more sensitive than adults. A baby's hearing development could be negatively impacted by exposure to certain sounds. The noise produced by a vacuum cleaner could disrupt a baby's sleep or overall well-being. There are factors that contribute to potential harm to a baby's ears when using a vacuum cleaner. There may be specific noise levels or decibel thresholds known to be harmful to infants' hearing. The distance from the vacuum cleaner could affect the potential harm to a baby's ears. There may be safety guidelines or recommendations for using a vacuum cleaner around infants. There may be alternatives or precautions that can be taken to minimize the risk of harm to a baby's ears during vacuuming.\nAnswer: The best way to protect your child's hearing is to keep them away from loud noises, and if you can't, have them wear noise cancelling headphones. If you need to raise your voice to talk to someone a few feet away, that is a good indication the noise is loud enough to hurt your child's hearing. Keeping the volume down on TVs, personal music players, and toys is an excellent habit to begin. Set a good example for your child and use hearing protection if you are going to a loud place."}
{"question": "How can I determine how many weeks pregnant I am if I don't have a regular cycle?", "answer": "Reasoning: A normal menstrual cycle is considered to be 28 days. Pregnancy calculations are typically based on a standard 28-day cycle. There are alternative methods to determine gestational age if someone has an irregular menstrual cycle.\nAnswer: Whether or not you have a regular period, the best way to determine your due date is a dating ultrasound. If you think you may be pregnant, you should schedule your first appointment within the first trimester. Dating ultrasounds that are completed before 14 weeks of gestation are hands down the most accurate. If you are pregnant as the result of assisted reproductive technology, be sure to speak with your provider as calculating your due date involves the age of the embryo and when it was transferred. Keep in mind each pregnancy is different, and your due date is only an estimate of when your baby will be born."}
{"question": "How long should I let my 5.5 week old sleep between feeds?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a recommended feeding frequency for a 5.5-week-old infant. There is a recommended amount of breast milk or formula that a 5.5-week-old baby should consume per feeding. There are signs that indicate a 5.5-week-old baby is hungry between feeds. There are ways to distinguish between hunger cues and other reasons for a baby's discomfort. There is an average duration of sleep for a 5.5-week-old infant during the day and night. There may be a need to wake a baby for feeds if they are sleeping for an extended period. All infants do not have the same sleep needs. Sleep patterns for infants may not be consistent and predictable. The baby's sleep duration may not be solely determined by the feeding interval. Not all babies have the same hunger cues and feeding needs.\nAnswer: Infants up to three months old should be sleeping between 14-17 hours in a 24 hour period. How long your baby sleeps between feeds depends on their own developmental skills as well as how much and what they are eating. Formula or bottle fed newborns often sleep more in the neighborhood of 3-4 hours between feeds, and it's more common for breastfed babies to sleep more around 2-3 hours between feeds. It's important to ask your baby's doctor how long they can sleep for a longer stretch at night. If they are not tracking on their growth curve or have other health issues, your provider may recommend waking them after a certain amount of time."}
{"question": "How warm is too warm for a nursery?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is an ideal temperature range for a baby's nursery. Temperature is a critical factor in a baby's well-being in the nursery. There may be potential harm or discomfort to a baby if the nursery is too warm. The temperature of the nursery may impact a baby's sleep and overall well-being. There are specific guidelines for room temperature in a nursery to prevent overheating. There are signs that indicate if a nursery is too warm for a baby.\nAnswer: It's important to monitor the temperature in your baby's sleeping space, as well as make sure they are dressed appropriately. The best temperature for your baby to sleep in is generally between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit or 20 to 22 degrees Celsius. Don't dress your baby in too few or many layers. A good rule of thumb is to check the skin on the back of their neck in their clothes. If this feels too hot and sweaty, they may be wearing too many layers."}
{"question": "Should I start rice cereal for my 4 month old baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: Rice cereal is considered a standard first food for infants. There may be benefits and drawbacks to introducing rice cereal to a 4-month-old baby. There are specific developmental signs that indicate a baby is ready for solid foods. There are nutritional needs that should be considered when introducing solid foods to a 4-month-old baby. There is a need for a smooth transition from breast milk or formula to rice cereal. Rice cereal may be the safest option for a baby's first solid food. There may be other options for introducing solids besides rice cereal. There may be other factors to consider besides safety when choosing a first solid food for a baby. There may be other affordable options for introducing solids besides rice cereal.\nAnswer: The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans both recommend that infants should not be introduced to foods other than breastmilk or formula prior to six months of age. This timeframe is just a guideline, as all babies are developmentally unique. Some signs your baby might show you that they are ready for other foods are good head and neck control, showing interest in foods, not spitting out food immediately, and being able to sit up alone or with support."}
{"question": "When is it safe to start dieting and exercising while breastfeeding?", "answer": "Reasoning: Exercise and dieting could have negative effects on breastfeeding. The timing of initiating diet and exercise postpartum may significantly impact breast milk production. There is a specific timeframe for when it is considered safe to start dieting and exercising after giving birth. Certain types of exercises or diet plans are inherently unsafe during breastfeeding. Changes in diet too soon after birth could alter the nutritional value of breast milk. There are changes that occur in a woman's body during the postpartum period that may impact the timing of starting a diet and exercise routine while breastfeeding. Breastfeeding affects a mother's energy and nutrient needs, which impacts the decision to start a diet and exercise program. There are specific recommendations or guidelines from healthcare professionals regarding the timing of initiating diet and exercise postpartum for breastfeeding mothers. The postpartum recovery process plays a role in determining when it's safe to begin dieting and exercising while breastfeeding. The mother's overall health, including any pre-existing conditions, factors into the decision of when to start dieting and exercising while breastfeeding.\nAnswer: Breastfeeding moms should consume at least 1800 calories per day, and a general guideline is that they can safely loose up to 1 pound per week. On average, they are also producing (and loosing from their body) about 25 ounces of fluid through breastmilk. It's more important than ever for you to stay hydrated if you are breastfeeding. Ensure that you discuss being cleared to exercise, your specific caloric needs, as well as what may be a safe weight loss goal for you with your doctor."}
{"question": "Is it okay to delay my anatomy scan until my health coverage begins at 23 weeks?", "answer": "Reasoning: Anatomy scans are an expensive test to get without insurance. Anatomy scans are not an urgent test to get during pregnancy. Anatomy scans can be done at any stage of pregnancy. Delaying the anatomy scan until 23 weeks may not compromise the accuracy or effectiveness of the scan. There is a recommended timing for an anatomy scan during pregnancy. There may be specific weeks during pregnancy when the anatomy scan is most accurate. The timing of the anatomy scan may relate to the development of the baby's organs. There may be potential risks or disadvantages associated with delaying the anatomy scan until later in pregnancy. Delaying the anatomy scan may affect the ability to detect certain fetal abnormalities or conditions.\nAnswer: The 20-week ultrasound is also known as the anatomy scan. It is usually performed between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy. This ultrasound takes an in depth look at the development of all fetal organs and body parts. If your baby cooperates and is in the right position, you can definitively find out the gender in this scan as well. As with delaying any recommended procedure, it's best to speak with your provider to gain personalized advice."}
{"question": "How can I maintain my milk supply while fasting and breastfeeding during Ramadan?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breastfeeding during fasting may have an impact on milk supply. There is a connection between nutritional intake during fasting and the nutritional quality of breast milk. Maintaining a proper milk supply while fasting is crucial for the health and well-being of the breastfeeding infant. Fasting could lead to a decrease in the overall quantity of breast milk produced. There are recommended meal timings or strategies for pre-dawn meals and breaking the fast for breastfeeding mothers during Ramadan. The duration of fasting hours can impact a breastfeeding mother's milk supply. Adjustments to the breastfeeding routine or frequency may be necessary during Ramadan to help maintain milk supply. Breastfeeding mothers need to strike a balance between religious observance and ensuring optimal nutrition for both themselves and their baby during fasting. Healthcare professionals or lactation consultants can provide guidance and support to breastfeeding mothers during Ramadan.\nAnswer: One of the best things you can do to maintain your milk supply is to drink water and remain as hydrated as possible during the hours this is allowable. A 2021 study of 21 fasting and 27 non-fasting women who were breastfeeding evaluated weight loss and the macronutrient content of the breastmilk. This study found there was no weight difference in the babies of either group during the month of Ramadan, and that there was no significant differences in their breastmilk."}
{"question": "Can they determine the gender on ultrasound at 19 weeks?", "answer": "Reasoning: Ultrasounds are a routine part of prenatal care. Determining the gender of the baby is a standard aspect of the ultrasound procedure. The accuracy of gender determination through ultrasound is high. The technology used in ultrasounds is advanced enough to clearly visualize and determine the gender. The 19-week mark is a specific and reliable point in pregnancy for gender identification. The determination of gender is a routine and straightforward aspect of the ultrasound, requiring no special conditions or considerations. There is a typical timeframe for determining gender through ultrasound. There may be specific markers or characteristics that sonographers look for during a 19-week ultrasound to determine gender. The accuracy of gender determination through ultrasound may vary at different stages of pregnancy.\nAnswer: The 20 week ultrasound, or anatomy scan, is a point in their pregnancy many women look forward to. This is a highly detailed ultrasound that takes a close look at all the developing organs and body parts, down to every finger and toe. Although the ultrasound technician tries there best, sometimes the baby is not positioned in a way where they can definitively see the baby's gender. That being said, most of the time they are able to visualize the gender and let the parents know at this time."}
{"question": "Can negative emotions during pregnancy cause serious harm to my baby leading to a miscarriage or stillbirth?", "answer": "Reasoning: Emotional experiences during pregnancy can have an impact on pregnancy outcomes. There is scientific evidence regarding the impact of maternal stress on pregnancy outcomes. There may be established connections between negative emotions during pregnancy and adverse fetal development. Stress hormones, such as cortisol, can affect the developing fetus in the womb. There may be specific types of negative emotions or stressors that pose a higher risk to the baby's well-being during pregnancy. There may be long-term consequences for the baby's health or development associated with maternal stress during pregnancy.\nAnswer: Although many women today still do not find out what exact factor caused their miscarriage or stillbirth, there is limited research to suggest that stress, anxiety, depression, and other negative emotions can affect the growth and development of the fetus. Protective factors, or things that can reduce the risk of miscarriage, are good health status before pregnancy and the initiative to obtain knowledge on how to care for yourself and your growing baby before and during pregnancy."}
{"question": "Can the quality of breast milk be affected by the mother's diet?", "answer": "Reasoning: The mother's diet can impact the nutritional content of breast milk. There are specific nutrients in the mother's diet that are crucial for optimal breast milk quality. Certain foods consumed by the mother can enhance or diminish the quality of breast milk. There may be specific foods that lactating mothers should avoid to prevent adverse effects on breast milk quality. My dietary restrictions could transfer to my baby through my breast milk. My hydration levels directly impact the volume and composition of my breast milk.\nAnswer: There is not a significant amount of research that specifically targets the relationship between a mother's diet and the quality of her breastmilk. Many studies only report indirect associations between the two, and aren't able to actually narrow it down to a positive correlation. We do know however that for mom and baby's health, it is important to eat a well-balanced diet and stay hydrated. Not having enough fluid intake can result in a low milk supply."}
{"question": "Is it safe to give my breastmilk if I have sepsis?", "answer": "Reasoning: Sepsis can affect the composition of breast milk. There is a potential for sepsis to be transmitted through breast milk. Precautions can be taken to ensure the safety of breast milk if a mother has sepsis. There may be specific tests or screenings to determine the safety of breast milk in the presence of sepsis. The timing and severity of sepsis can impact the safety of breast milk. There may be medications used to treat sepsis that can be present in breast milk and pose a risk to the infant. There may be a recommended waiting period after recovering from sepsis before resuming breastfeeding.\nAnswer: If you are sick with certain illnesses such as the flu, COVID-19, diarrhea, or mastitis, you can and should continue breastfeeding. Although it's ok to breastfeed while taking most medications, certain medications may not be recommended while breastfeeding. If you are hospitalized or receiving emergency care, be sure to let your provider know you are breastfeeding. They can help you determine if it's safe to continue, or if you need to stop they can help you make a plan on how to keep up your milk supply while you are sick."}
{"question": "When is it safe for my baby to be around unvaccinated relatives?", "answer": "Reasoning: Unvaccinated relatives pose a higher risk of transmitting infectious diseases to my baby. Vaccinations are important for preventing the spread of disease. Contact with an unvaccinated person is more dangerous for a baby than for an adult. A baby's immune system is susceptible to infectious diseases. Unvaccinated people should not be around newborn babies. There is a risk associated with bringing a baby around unvaccinated relatives. There are safety precautions that can be taken if bringing a baby around unvaccinated relatives. There is a certain amount of time after a baby receives their vaccinations that is safe to bring them around unvaccinated relatives. Unvaccinated relatives could potentially infect a baby with a disease even if they are not showing symptoms.\nAnswer: In general, a baby's family members and caregivers should be up to date on their vaccinations to help protect the baby from disease. Newborns do not have fully developed immune systems, which makes them vulnerable to infections. Anyone who is around them should be up to date on all routine vaccines, especially the flu shot and the Tdap vaccine. Whooping cough is the most dangerous for babies, and they don't start getting their own vaccines for it until they are two months old. Babies younger than six months can't get their flu shot, and they are at risk of serious complications if they contract the flu."}
{"question": "Is it normal to not want to hold my baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: Feeling an immediate and overwhelming bond with the baby is not a universal and expected response after childbirth. Some parents may feel uneasy about holding their babies. There may be common reasons why a parent might not want to hold their baby. Postpartum depression or anxiety can impact a parent's desire to hold their baby. There may be cultural or societal factors that influence a parent's comfort with holding their baby. Some parents may experience challenges bonding with their newborns.\nAnswer: If you feel like you are having challenges bonding with your baby, it's really important that you bring this up at your baby's visit to their pediatrician. This can be a sign of postpartum depression. If your baby has had unexpected or significant health issues, this can also delay bonding. Or, you may just feel exhausted and overwhelmed by the arrival of your new baby. No matter the reason, it's always better to identify the problem sooner. Health care professionals are accustomed to dealing with issues like this and can provide help, support, and resources."}
{"question": "Is there any benefit to getting a carrier screening if you're already pregnant?", "answer": "Reasoning: Carrier screening may provide valuable information about potential genetic risks during pregnancy. Carrier screening may be recommended for couples who are already pregnant to assess genetic conditions. Carrier screening can help identify if both partners carry the same genetic mutation that could affect the baby. Carrier screening during pregnancy can offer insights into the likelihood of passing on specific genetic disorders to the baby. Carrier screening may be a relevant option for assessing genetic risks even after conception has occurred. Receiving a carrier screening while pregnant may have potential risks or implications for the current pregnancy that outweigh any potential benefits. The results of carrier screening may not influence medical decisions or interventions during the current pregnancy. Genetic information obtained from carrier screening may not provide actionable insights or affect the current pregnancy management.\nAnswer: As with any diagnostic testing, to help you make the best decision for you and your baby, you should discuss all options with your provider. Carrier screening is a genetic test that tells whether you carry the gene for certain genetic disorders. It allows you to find our your changes of having a child with a genetic disorder. There is no right or wrong answer, and having this testing done is up to you."}
{"question": "Why isn't my baby hungry?", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be reasons other than hunger that can cause a baby to not be hungry. There may be illnesses that can cause a baby to not feel hungry. There may be medical concerns associated with a baby not feeding regularly. There are signs and cues that can indicate if a baby is full during feeding. There may be a point at which a lack of appetite in a baby requires medical attention. Hunger is not the sole motivator for a baby to feed. A baby's feeding patterns may not always remain constant.\nAnswer: Formula or breastmilk should be all your baby has until six months or later, depending on their readiness for solid foods. If your baby is acting like they aren't hungry, they may want to be held, changed, entertained, or they may not know what they want. General guidelines stated that your baby should eat every 3-4 hours. If your baby is having a decrease in wet and or dirty diapers, and you can't get them to eat for 8 hours, you should seek emergency care."}
{"question": "Should I wait until after my baby arrives to get a breast pump?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breast pumps are not necessary until after the baby is born and breastfeeding has started. There is a recommended timeline for acquiring a breast pump. There is a best time to start shopping for a breast pump. There may be benefits to obtaining a breast pump before the baby arrives. There may be circumstances where it's preferable to wait until after the baby is born to get a breast pump. The decision to use a breast pump can be delayed until after experiencing any potential breastfeeding challenges. The need for a breast pump is solely dependent on the mother's intention to exclusively breastfeed or not. There is no urgency in acquiring a breast pump, and it can be purchased or obtained easily whenever needed. There may be a specific advantage to delaying the purchase of a breast pump until after childbirth.\nAnswer: There are several things you can do in the last month of your pregnancy to prepare for breastfeeding. Most health insurance companies will cover the cost of a breast pump, so research what specific pump models your insurance will cover. They pump usually requires a prescription from your OB-GYN, so ensure you plan ahead. Most insurance companies will also cover lactation counseling. You can get a referral from your provider and also look on the internet directory from the International Lactation Consultant Association."}
{"question": "Is it harmful to wait 12 weeks for the first prenatal appointment?", "answer": "Reasoning: The recommended timeframe for scheduling the first prenatal appointment exists. There may be potential risks associated with delaying the first prenatal visit. There are factors that contribute to the urgency of scheduling an early prenatal appointment. There is a critical window during pregnancy when early medical attention is particularly important. There may be specific health concerns that might arise if the first prenatal appointment is delayed. Prenatal care is essential in the early stages of pregnancy. Early prenatal appointments may provide crucial information that can impact the overall health of the pregnancy. Complications can occur early on in pregnancy. The timing of prenatal appointments can have an impact on the pregnancy outcome. Overall health and lifestyle choices may not have a more substantial impact on the pregnancy outcome than the timing of prenatal appointments.\nAnswer: Although its best to make an appointment soon when you find out you are pregnant, as long as you are in to see a provider prior to 14 weeks of gestation, you'll be able to have a dating ultrasound which is important for many aspects of prenatal care. The first OB appointment will go over your medical history, due date, physical exam, and generally lab work. It's usually safe to plan that you'll have appointments every four weeks from this point on during your pregnancy."}
{"question": "What medications should I bring to the hospital for my induction?", "answer": "Reasoning: All necessary medications for induction may not be provided by the hospital. Personal medications may be required for a smoother and more comfortable induction process. The hospital may not have specific medications tailored to individual needs during induction. Personal over-the-counter medications may be suitable for use during a hospital induction. There are specific recommendations for what medications to bring to the hospital for induction. What information should be prepared before going to the hospital for induction? Which medications are essential to have on hand when going to the hospital for induction? What should be brought from home to the hospital when going to be induced? Do prescribed and over-the-counter medications need to be brought to the hospital when being induced?\nAnswer: When preparing for a labor induction, know that generally your provider will try to stick to your schedule, but depending on the size of the facility where you plan to give birth, if many women come in already in labor, your planned induction could be delayed. Sometimes you'll come in the day before for lab work, but it's also possible to have your labs drawn when you are admitted for your induction. Usually you don't need to bring any medications, but if you are unsure you can go over a list of medications you take with your provider at an appointment prior to your induction."}
{"question": "What temperature is considered serious enough to call the doctor for my 13-week-old baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: A 13-week-old baby can run a fever. There is a specific body temperature that is considered abnormal for a 13-week-old infant. There is a point at which I should be concerned about my baby's body temperature. There may be specific signs or symptoms related to temperature that indicate I should call the doctor for my 13-week-old. There is a normal range of body temperature for a 13-week-old baby. There may be certain situations where a slightly elevated temperature in my baby would be cause for concern. A baby's body temperature regulation may not be the same as that of adults. Mild fluctuations in the baby's body temperature may not be a cause for concern. Not all fevers in infants require immediate medical attention. There may not be a specific numerical temperature reading universally considered the threshold for medical intervention. Healthcare providers may not all have the same criteria for determining when a baby's fever requires attention.\nAnswer: It can be alarming when your new baby gets their first fever. Keep in mind a fever is usually a sign that your body is fighting off infection, which is a good thing. Also note that each child's medical history may be different and you should ask your child's pediatrician at what temperature you should seek care for them. A rectal reading above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius is considered a true fever. At these temperatures, you should call your doctor or take your baby to urgent care to be seen promptly."}
{"question": "When is it appropriate to leave my 16 month old in the car for quick errands?", "answer": "Reasoning: Leaving a child in the car for short periods may be a common practice. The child may be safe if the errand is brief and the weather conditions are mild. There may be minimal risks associated with leaving a child in the car for a short time. There may be potential dangers of leaving a 16-month-old unattended in a car. The temperature inside a car can rise quickly, even on a moderately warm day. There may be ways to ensure the safety and well-being of a child when left alone in the car. Precautions may need to be taken before considering leaving a child alone in the car. There may be specific guidelines or legal regulations regarding leaving a child unattended in a vehicle.\nAnswer: While every parent may encounter a situation where they are tempted to crack the windows and leave their sleeping child in the car, this is never a safe option. 38 children each year in the U.S. die from heat stroke after being trapped in a car. The temperature in a care can increase 20 degrees in just 10 minutes and 40 degrees in an hour. It doesn't have to feel hot outside to be dangerous in a car: deaths have happened when it's 70 degrees out. Other risks that can happen are being trapped in the trunk, setting the car in motion, or being taken from the car."}
{"question": "How long can I safely let my 3-week-old baby cry without causing emotional trauma?", "answer": "Reasoning: Crying is a normal part of a baby's development and can be managed without causing harm. Crying is primarily a means of communication for physical needs. Allowing a baby to cry for an extended period can promote independence and self-soothing. Delayed response to a baby's cries can help build resilience and adaptability. There are recommended strategies for soothing a fussy 3-week-old baby. There are typical reasons for a 3-week-old baby to cry, and ways to address them. There are different types of cries that indicate hunger, discomfort, or tiredness. There may be potential consequences of leaving a newborn to cry for extended periods.\nAnswer: All babies cry. On average, newborns cry between one and four hours a day. Your job as their caretaker is to try to figure out why they are crying, and to address their needs as best you can. Babies cry for many reasons, and over time you might be able to decipher which cry means what. They might be hungry, need a diaper change, want to be held, want to move, or simply overwhelmed. If you have addressed all needs a need a break yourself to remain calm and collected, it's ok to leave your baby in their crib for 10-15 minutes to see if they fall asleep or calm down at all. No matter how frustrated you get, never hit, shake, or jerk a baby. The baby could be seriously hurt or even die."}
{"question": "Does what a breastfeeding mother eats affect the baby?", "answer": "Reasoning: The nutritional content of breast milk can be influenced by the mother's diet. There may be certain foods that a breastfeeding mother should avoid to prevent discomfort or health issues in the baby. A mother's diet can impact the flavor of breast milk and potentially impact the baby's taste preferences. Maternal nutrition plays a role in ensuring the baby receives essential vitamins and minerals through breastfeeding. Certain foods in a mother's diet can lead to allergies or sensitivities in the breastfed baby. The assumption that breast milk automatically adapts to meet the changing needs of the growing baby, regardless of the mother's nutritional intake, may not be accurate.\nAnswer: Generally breastfeeding moms need to eat about 330-400 additional calories a day for the energy and nutrition to make milk. Making healthy choices and eating a well-balanced diet can ensure the flavor of your breastmilk varies (exposing your baby to different tastes) and make sure you and baby are getting all the nutrients you need. Most providers recommend you continue to take prenatal vitamins while breastfeeding. It's also important to stay hydrated. A good tip is to drink a glass of water each time you breastfeed."}
{"question": "Is it possible to temporarily stall weight gain during pregnancy in a healthy way?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are safe and healthy ways to manage weight during pregnancy. It is possible to balance nutrition to support the baby's development without excessive weight gain. There are specific exercises that are safe for pregnant women and can help control weight gain. Hydration plays a role in managing weight during pregnancy. There may be dietary supplements or vitamins that can support a healthy pregnancy weight. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help avoid unnecessary weight gain during pregnancy. There may be common misconceptions about weight gain during pregnancy that need to be addressed.\nAnswer: One of the topics your provider covers with you during each prenatal appointment is healthy weight gain. The guidelines for this differ based on your pre-pregnancy weight or BMI. In general, if you are underweight prior to pregnancy you may need to gain more weight, about 28-40 pounds. On the other end of the spectrum, if you are obese or your BMI is greater than 30, you should only gain between 11-20 pounds during pregnancy. This advice may differ based on your medical history and how many babies you are pregnant with."}
{"question": "Will my milk supply be affected if my baby doesn't feed from 12am to 4am?", "answer": "Reasoning: The frequency of nighttime breastfeeding sessions can impact overall milk production. Nocturnal breastfeeding plays a role in maintaining a healthy milk supply. Skipping nighttime feeds can lead to a decrease in milk production. There may be specific times during the night when breastfeeding is crucial for sustaining milk supply. The body's prolactin production is related to nighttime breastfeeding and milk production. A mother's milk supply may be affected when her baby sleeps through the night without feeding. The timing of feeding during the night has an impact on the overall milk supply. My baby's nutritional needs during the night can be met adequately during other feeding times. Milk supply is primarily determined by overall daily feedings rather than specific time intervals. My baby's growth and development won't be adversely affected by a temporary break in nighttime feedings.\nAnswer: As your baby grows and changes, your milk supply will too. While your newborn may be eating around the clock every 2-3 hours, by the time your baby is 4 months old they may sleep 6 hours through the night and eat only every 3-4 hours during the day. Your baby will take in more milk with each feeding as they grow to hold them over for longer periods, and your milk supply will adjust to this new routine. Letting the baby sleep for longer periods as they grow won't hurt your breastfeeding efforts."}
{"question": "Is there a relationship between the severity of period pains and the severity of contractions during labor?", "answer": "Reasoning: The intensity of menstrual cramps may be related to the intensity of contractions during labor. Hormonal changes in the body may play a role in both menstrual cramps and labor contractions. There may be common physiological factors that contribute to the intensity of both period pains and labor contractions. The severity of menstrual cramps may be indicative of potential challenges during labor. The severity of menstrual cramps may be considered a potential predictor for the intensity of contractions during labor.\nAnswer: Each pregnancy, woman's body, and labor experience are totally different. Some women may show up to labor and delivery at 7 centimeters, only experiencing mild pain. Others may be remote from labor with a closed cervix and not be coping well at all. As you prepare for labor, remember to be kind to your body and stay as hydrated and well rested as you can. Being prepared with breathing exercises, relaxation strategies, and a support person can help you conquer whatever your labor throws at you."}
{"question": "Is it difficult for a preemie to nurse?", "answer": "Reasoning: Preemies may face challenges when it comes to feeding. There may be specific difficulties associated with breastfeeding a preemie. The prematurity of a baby can affect their ability to nurse. There may be unique considerations or obstacles when it comes to nursing a premature infant. The early birth of a baby can impact their feeding patterns. Interventions or support may be needed for preemies concerning breastfeeding. Not all preemies can successfully breastfeed and may require alternative feeding methods. The difficulty in nursing for preemies is primarily due to their size and physical immaturity. The mother's milk production may not be a significant factor in the nursing difficulty for preemies.\nAnswer: Giving birth to a premature baby does not mean you can't breastfeed. It is arguably more important for your premature baby to receive your breastmilk, so your care team may start you hand expressing and pumping ASAP. Mother's of premature babies produce breastmilk that is slightly different in composition, at least for the first few weeks, and has more protein and minerals. It's important to inform your infant's care team that you desire to breastfeed your baby. Your baby may need extra support, and by the time they are developmentally ready to breastfeed, a lactation counselor can assist you."}
{"question": "When is it safe to start trying to conceive after giving birth?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are medical guidelines regarding the recommended waiting period before attempting to conceive again. There are recommendations regarding child spacing. There may be specific risks associated with attempting to conceive too soon after giving birth. The body takes a certain amount of time to recover after childbirth.\nAnswer: For most women, it's best to wait at least 18 months between getting birth and getting pregnant again. This means your baby will be at least 1 1/2 years old before you get pregnant with another baby. This gives your body time to fully recover from your last pregnancy before it's ready for the next one. Getting pregnant prior to 18 months can increase your risk of premature birth, low birthweight, and your next baby being small for gestational age."}
{"question": "How much do newborns eat in the first couple of days and should I give them water?", "answer": "Reasoning: Newborns have specific nutritional requirements. There are specific guidelines for feeding practices for newborns during the initial days after birth. The digestive system of a newborn is not fully developed and cannot handle various types of foods. Giving water to a newborn in the first few days may have potential risks. Newborns cannot consume solid foods shortly after birth. The quantity of food a newborn needs may vary among babies. The nutritional needs of newborns are different from those of adults. There are certain foods or drinks that should not be given to newborns.\nAnswer: Newborns typically will nurse between 8-12 times in 24 hours, and if they are bottle feeding they will consume about 1.5-3 ounces every 2-3 hours. Until babies are six months old, they will get all the hydration and nutrients they need from either breastmilk or formula. Most babies are developmentally ready to begin eating other foods at around six months of age. If you have any questions about feeding your newborn, talk with your doctor."}
{"question": "How to avoid pressure to breastfeed while in the hospital?", "answer": "Reasoning: Doctors and nurses at the hospital may try to pressure mothers into breastfeeding. Hospital staff may shame mothers for not wanting to breastfeed. There are strategies that can be used to communicate feeding preferences with hospital staff. There may be support services available for mothers who choose not to breastfeed in the hospital. Mothers should provide information to hospital staff regarding their preferred feeding method. Mothers can take steps in the hospital setting to ensure their chosen feeding method is respected. Mothers may need to advocate for themselves and maintain confidence in their feeding choices despite external pressures in the hospital.\nAnswer: Research studies have suggested that mom's feel mainly pressure from themselves and society to breastfeed. Pressure to breastfeed was associated with a negative breastfeeding experience. It's important to reduce perceived pressure to promote breastfeeding outcomes. It's your decision to feed your baby by whatever strategy works best for your family. You can let your hospital care team know what your plan is, and they can help you work towards accomplishing this."}

A pelvic exam contributes to the overall assessment of a woman's health following a cesarean delivery. There may be concerns or complications related to c-section recovery that can be identified through a pelvic exam during a postnatal appointment.\nAnswer: After both a vaginal and cesarean delivery, your provider will want to see you for a postpartum checkup, generally about 8 weeks after delivery. If you had a cesarean section, they will check on your incision to ensure it's healing well. They will also perform a pelvic exam to ensure your vagina, uterus, and cervix are healing well. In addition to the physical exam, your provider will look over your vital signs and talk with you about how things are going with your new baby."}
{"question": "How many ounces of breast milk should I be pumping at 2 weeks postpartum?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a typical range of ounces of breast milk produced by a mother at 2 weeks postpartum. The amount of breast milk pumped is not a direct measure of breastfeeding success or the baby's nutritional intake. Pumping output can vary and is not consistent or predictable for all breastfeeding individuals at the same postpartum stage. There may be individual variations in the amount of breast milk that should be pumped at 2 weeks postpartum. There is a recommended frequency for pumping at 2 weeks postpartum to maintain a healthy milk supply. There are factors that can affect the amount of breast milk pumped at 2 weeks postpartum. There is a normal pumping session duration for a mother at 2 weeks postpartum. There may be specific cues or signs that indicate if a mother is pumping enough breast milk at 2 weeks postpartum.\nAnswer: If you begin pumping when your baby is born, you ideally want to be pumping every 2-3 hours to mimic when your baby would be eating. This can help kick off the supply and demand aspect of your milk supply. The amount you pump can depend on your stress levels, condition of your pump parts, and how well the flanges fit your nipples. It can be really helpful to see a lactation counselor to help you make sure your pumping journey is off to a good start."}
{"question": "When is it safe to have sex after a third degree episiotomy?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a standard or universally agreed-upon timeframe for resuming sexual activity after a third-degree episiotomy. Healing times for episiotomies may vary based on factors such as age, overall health, or individual recovery. Resuming sexual activity after a third-degree episiotomy is dependent on the physical healing of the episiotomy. Factors such as emotional and psychological considerations may not be involved in the decision to resume sexual activity. There are factors that contribute to the healing time of a third-degree episiotomy. There may be specific signs that indicate the episiotomy is healing properly. It generally takes a certain amount of time for a third-degree episiotomy to heal. There are recommended postoperative care measures for a third-degree episiotomy.\nAnswer: Most doctors recommend that you wait at least six weeks after giving birth to have sex again. This time is to help heal any vaginal tear or episiotomy, cesarean incision, and from the birth process in general. Many women wait until they've been seen by their doctor postpartum to be cleared if they have any specific concerns. It can be a good idea to take things slow, and use lubrication especially if you're breastfeeding. The hormones that help you breastfeed may increase vaginal dryness.

{"question": "Should I opt for an induction or wait for my body to go into labor naturally?", "answer": "Reasoning: My body has the ability to naturally induce labor. I have the right to make a decision about whether to opt for induction or wait for natural labor. There may be potential risks and benefits associated with opting for induction. My healthcare provider may have a recommendation regarding induction versus natural labor. There may be specific circumstances or conditions that could make waiting for natural labor a better option. There is scientific evidence available regarding the outcomes of induced labor versus natural labor. The overall health of both the mother and the baby may play a role in the decision between induction and waiting for natural labor. Inductions are a common and accepted practice in childbirth.\nAnswer: The induction of labor is when your provider uses medications or other methods to bring on the process of labor. The decision of whether or not to be induced is a personal one, and depends on your medical history, your pregnancy and any complications, your personal feelings, and your provider's recommendations. Many providers will not do an elective (not for medical reason) induction before 39 weeks of gestation. Some women are advised by their doctor to have a medically indicated induction at 38 weeks. Sometimes this is because they have been diagnosed with gestational hypertension, they have poorly controlled diabetes, or because there are complications with their pregnancy."}

A good book or two will eventually become more important than a long nursing session."}
{"question": "How big of a risk is co-sleeping?", "answer": "Reasoning: Co-sleeping is considered risky. There are factors that contribute to the safety of co-sleeping. There are specific guidelines for ensuring a safe co-sleeping environment. The age of the child can affect the level of risk in co-sleeping situations. There is research and studies that provide insights into the potential risks of co-sleeping. There may be common misconceptions about the risks of co-sleeping.\nAnswer: Bed-sharing or co-sleeping is something health experts warn parents not to do for safety issues. Bed-sharing increases the risk of suffocation, strangulation, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Adult beds have many safety risks for babies. The surface is too soft and the soft mattress as well as pillows, blankets, and quilts post suffocation risks. There is also the risk for the infant or child to become stuck in part of the bed frame. Because of the risks, the American Academy of Pediatrics warn against bed-sharing, but recommend baby sleep in the same room in their own sleep surface."}
{"question": "Is it okay to use nipple shields while breastfeeding to help with pain and sensory issues?", "answer": "Reasoning: Nipple shields are commonly recommended for addressing pain during breastfeeding.

{"question": "Is engorgement a good indicator of your breast milk supply?", "answer": "Reasoning: Engorgement is not always a good indicator of breast milk supply. Engorgement does not always reflect the exact quantity of breast milk available. Not all instances of engorgement indicate a surplus of milk. Engorgement is not a consistent and reliable sign of sufficient milk supply. The absence of engorgement does not necessarily mean there is an insufficient milk supply. Engorgement may be influenced by factors other than the quantity of breast milk. Not all breastfeeding mothers will experience engorgement even if their milk supply is abundant. There are physical sensations that can indicate fullness and tightness in the breasts. There are other signs that can suggest the body is producing an ample supply of breast milk. There are positive signals that can indicate the breasts are adequately filled with milk while breastfeeding. There are physical changes in the breasts that can suggest the milk production is meeting the baby's needs. The sensation of fullness in the breasts may not always directly relate to the adequacy of the breast milk supply.\nAnswer: Breast engorgement is common in the first week after giving birth, and is generally a sign that your milk is coming in. Both breasts will be swollen, firm and painful. A lot of the swelling is blood and lymph fluids rushing to the area to help start making mature breastmilk. You will notice the volume of milk increase, but all the swelling you notice is not from breastmilk. Continue to feed or pump based on your infant's needs. Engorgement usually resolves within a few days."}

There may be certain medications or substances that should be avoided during pregnancy to prevent IUGR. There may not be a singular cause of IUGR in pregnancy. The risk factors for IUGR may not be consistent across all pregnancies.\nAnswer: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) can be caused by a myriad of issues, some that you can prevent and some that you can't. Some of the preventable causes include drug use, smoking, and alcohol use. Some nonpreventable causes are multiple babies in the pregnancy, a previous pregnancy that was IUGR, high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and more. Sometimes IUGR is caused by multiple factors, or the provider is unable to determine what is causing it."}
{"question": "When can you start giving baby blankets in bed?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies typically transition from swaddling to using blankets in bed at a certain age. There is a recommended time to introduce soft bedding, such as baby blankets, into a crib. Pediatricians may suggest parents start incorporating blankets into their baby's sleep routine at a certain point. There is a developmental milestone that marks the appropriate time to introduce blankets to a baby's sleep environment. There are safety guidelines regarding the appropriate time to provide babies with blankets during sleep. It is generally advised to start using blankets for warmth during sleep at a certain point in a baby's growth and development. Blankets are a common and essential item for a baby's sleep environment. There are signs and cues that indicate a baby is ready to have a blanket in bed. Baby blankets contribute positively to a baby's sleep quality.\nAnswer: The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents that it's not safe for babies to sleep with blankets unless they are over one year old. All soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys should be kept out of your baby's sleep area. All of these things can pose risk for suffocation.

There are specific foods or beverages believed to have positive effects on inducing labor naturally. There are natural methods to encourage the onset of labor. There are activities that may help promote the initiation of labor in a safe manner. There are non-invasive ways to encourage the progression of labor naturally. There may be a level of control one can exert over the timing of labor. Inducing labor at home is a more comfortable or familiar setting than a hospital.\nAnswer: Many of the tricks and tips people may tell you will start labor earlier are not backed by evidence and may not be safe. This is a good topic to bring up with your care provider to ask what methods may or may not be safe for you. Some of the methods are risky because they may cause your uterus to be irritable and contract too much, which can stress out your baby. If you are at home, you might not know that your baby is not being well oxygenated throughout the increased levels of contractions."}

There is a specific amount of formula that a baby will need per day.\nAnswer: Connecting with professionals that are skilled in caring for babies is an essential part of preparing for baby.   Taking prenatal classes can be a wonderful way to learn all you can about birth, infant feeding and newborn basics.  It is also recommended to take a CPR class as well.  During these classes, you'll not only be able to ask questions, but also gather lists of important items to purchase.  A proper car seat, diapers, wipes, clothes, and a safe sleeping surface for baby (cot or crib) are the bare essentials, with feeding choices dictating other purchases.  If you are nursing, a breast pump and pads are important.  For formula feeding families, bottles, formula, and access to clean water are essential."}
{"question": "How does aspirin reduce preeclampsia risk?", "answer": "Reasoning: Aspirin has the potential to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a condition that exists. There are risk factors associated with preeclampsia. There is a recommendation to take aspirin to prevent preeclampsia. There is a concern about the safety of taking aspirin during pregnancy.\nAnswer: Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by persistent high blood pressure.  For people at high risk of pre-eclampsia, low dose aspirin is recommended by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists from 12 weeks until delivery.  Aspirin helps lower the risk by relaxing the blood vessels, keeping blood pressure in check and allowing for proper blood flow not only for the parent, but for the baby as well."}

From then on, two to three times weekly is sufficient for the first year, as long as the diaper area is cleaned frequently and the skin is kept dry.  Bathing more often than this can dry baby's skin out."}
{"question": "Is almond milk better than cows milk?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are different types of milk that are appropriate for different age groups. There may be nutritional benefits to both cow's milk and almond milk. There is a recommended amount of milk that should be consumed. There are alternative milk options for those who cannot consume cow's milk. Some milks may be better than others. Consumer milk is considered good or recommended. Cow's milk may not be good for everyone.\nAnswer: Almond milk and other milk-alternatives are popular choices for adults who choose not to eat dairy.  They are not, however, nutritionally balanced as a replacement for cow's milk for toddlers and children and are never an appropriate substitution for breast milk or infant formula.  For toddlers over the age of 1 who are unable to eat dairy, a well balanced diet supplemented with a milk alternative closer to cow's milk (such as pea protein or oat) can give adequate Vitamin D and Calcium.  Always discuss nutrition with your primary care provider."}
{"question": "How can I clear my babies stuffy nose?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies can get congested noses. Congestion in infants can cause problems for the baby. There are safe ways to clear a baby's stuffy nose. There may be a need for intervention when a baby has a stuffy nose. There may be a point at which medical attention should be sought for a baby with a cold.\nAnswer: If your baby is ill or stuffy to the point where breathing and feeding is difficult, you may use saline and a bulb syringe to gently clear the nasal passages.  After placing 2 drops of saline into the nostril, squeeze the bulb syringe to expel air.  Insert the tip into the nostril (1/4 inch in), block the other nostril, and release the bulb.  Mucus will be suctioned into the bulb.  Empty the bulb by squeezing it rapidly into a tissue.  Repeat on the other side.  You can do this as often as you need, but try not to be too aggressive as the nasal passages are small and can become easily inflamed making stuffiness worse.  Remember to always clean your bulb syringe with soap and hot water."}

There is a way that babies learn language. It is possible for babies to learn more than one language at the same time. Learning more than one language is beneficial. Learning languages early in life is beneficial.\nAnswer: The best way to help a baby learn two languages at the same time is through exposure and need. Exposing them to both languages in a natural setting with multiple providers will help them learn. If using both languages helps the child get what they need and helps them communicate with people and be understood, this will help them be motivated to use both.   Natural and varied settings can help as well."}
{"question": "Is it normal that I started producing milk before baby is born?", "answer": "Reasoning: Lactation can start before birth. There may be a way to induce lactation before birth. Lactating before birth may not necessarily mean that something is wrong.\nAnswer: It is normal to start producing baby's first milk, called colostrum, before baby is born.

In general, newborns up to one week will generally nurse for short periods of 10-15 minutes as often as every 1-2 hours.  After the first week, when mature milk is established, infants will nurse on average between 20-30 minutes per session.  As they get older, often at the 3 month mark, they might become more efficient, nursing for 10-15 minutes.  The most important thing to note is baby's temperament and diapers.  If your baby is nursing for longer or shorter than these time periods, but is gaining weight well, making appropriate diapers and is generally happy, then this is not a sign that anything is wrong."}

{"question": "How long does the baby have sensitive skin?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies may have more sensitive skin than older children and adults. There is a certain age at which babies no longer have sensitive skin. There are precautions that need to be taken due to the sensitivity of babies' skin. Exposure to different substances can cause skin irritation in babies.\nAnswer: Newborn skin is ever evolving and changing.  For the first two years, infant and toddler skin is not fully formed and therefore is not as strong of a barrier of protection as it is in adults.  It is important to bathe baby gently, avoiding harsh chemicals and soaps, and keep them moisturized during the first two years while this barrier is being formed."}
{"question": "can I sleep during NST?", "answer": "Reasoning: Sleeping during NST may alter the results of the test. Being asleep or awake may affect the baby's stress level during NST.\nAnswer: It is important that you are awake for the non-stress test because you will need to press a buzzer or let the technician know when you feel the baby move. If baby is not active, you will also need to be involved to help get baby to become active. Eating a meal before the test and bringing snacks and a cold drink can help the baby to move."}
{"question": "Is it okay to lay on back for short periods of time?", "answer": "Reasoning: Laying on my back during pregnancy might cause harm to myself or my baby. Laying on my back might cause long-term injury. It might not be safe to lay on my back at all during pregnancy. There is a position that I should sleep in during pregnancy. There is a gestational age at which it is not fine to lay on my back for long periods.\nAnswer: Laying on your back for brief periods of time during pregnancy is generally safe, but recommendations from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology encourage all pregnant people to sleep on their side.  Sleeping on your back during your second and third trimester can put pressure on a major blood vessel which can slow blood flow to the baby and make you dizzy."}
{"question": "Does breast feeding help lose weight?", "answer": "Reasoning: Breastfeeding may impact metabolism and nutrition. There may be a desire to lose weight after having a baby. There may be a need to eat differently while breastfeeding. There may be a way to lose weight after having a baby if not breastfeeding.\nAnswer: Breastfeeding on demand burns roughly 500 calories a day, but it does not necessarily help with weight loss due to increased appetite during nursing. Studies have shown marginal effects, but these are merely correlations and not direct links.  It is more important to focus on eating healthy foods and being active for weight loss postpartum and allowing the body to heal.  It took 9 months to put the weight on.  It is ok if it takes time for it to come off."}
{"question": "What is the most recommended way to cut my baby's nails?", "answer": "Reasoning: Baby's nails need to be trimmed. There is a recommended frequency for cutting baby's nails. There is a recommended length for baby's nails. There is a debate between cutting or filing baby's nails.\nAnswer: The best way to cut baby's nails is to wait until they are asleep.  Pushing down the fingertip skin will allow you to get under the nail on both sides and avoid trimming their skin on accident.  If there are any sharp edges, you can file them gently with an emery board."}
{"question": "How much calcium is needed in the second trimester?", "answer": "Reasoning: Calcium needs change with each trimester of pregnancy. There is a recommended amount of calcium intake needed in the second trimester. Calcium can be obtained through diet or supplements. Calcium plays a role in a healthy pregnancy. There may be risks associated with calcium deficiency.\nAnswer: You will generally need between 1,000-1,300 mg of calcium during pregnancy.  Milk and other dairy products, as well as broccoli, fortified foods, sardines and dark leafy greens are all good sources of calcium.  If you are having difficulty with nutrition, talk to your midwife or obstetrician. Supplements are available if needed."}
{"question": "Is my baby having nightmares?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies can dream. Babies can have nightmares. There may be reasons other than nightmares for a baby to cry or whimper during sleep. There is a way to comfort a baby if they seem distressed while sleeping.\nAnswer: It is common for babies to cry out in the middle of the night.  Typical reasons include hunger or discomfort, but one cause is what pediatricians refer to as confusional arousal.  This is when a baby might cry or look frightened but be completely asleep, calling out with a cry as they move between sleep cycles.  This is nothing to worry about and is not a nightmare."}
{"question": "What is a good home remedy for stuffy nose ?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are safe ways to treat congestion in babies. There are things that should be avoided when trying to reduce congestion. There may be different causes of congestion. There is a way to treat stuffy noses.\nAnswer: You can use saline and a bulb syringe to gently clear the nasal passages if your baby is stuffy. After placing 2 drops of saline into the nostril, squeeze the bulb syringe to expel air. Insert the tip into the nostril (1/4 inch in), block the other nostril, and release the bulb. Mucus will be suctioned into the bulb. Empty the bulb by squeezing it rapidly into a tissue. Repeat on the other side. You can do this as often as you need, but try not to be too aggressive as the nasal passages are small and can become easily inflamed making stuffiness worse. Remember to always clean your bulb syringe with soap and hot water. Cold mist humidifiers and keeping a higher humidity in your home can help as well."}
{"question": "Is breast feeding or formula better?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are factors that need to be considered when deciding between breast and bottle feeding. There is a difference in nutritional value between breastmilk and formula. There is a difference in nutrition between different formulas and breast milk can vary person to person or with changes in diet. Feasibility for the mother is an important factor in deciding between breast and bottle feeding. There is not one right choice for feeding babies. Mothers may be at risk of making a wrong choice.\nAnswer: Experts agree that human milk is a better nutritional choice for infants.  Nutrients in human milk are better absorbed and human milk is a living substance, changing on a daily basis to meet the nutritional and immunological needs of the infant.  This being said, the feeding choice that is right for each family is personal and the best choice is the one that meets the infants nutritional needs and allows the parents to bond and enjoy their newborn."}
{"question": "How long should I pump breast milk for?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a recommended amount of breast milk that a baby needs. There is a way to know if a mother's milk supply is adequate for the baby's needs. There is a point at which cow's milk can be introduced to the baby. There may be some considerations about the feasibility and desirability of pumping for a mother. There is a potential option to supplement breastfeeding with formula.\nAnswer: If you are separated from your newborn for any reason, it is important that you pump at least every two to three hours for 15-20 minutes to try and mimic the physiologically normal rhythm of infant feeding.  Even if you are not getting any milk out at the 10 minute mark, continuing for 15 to 20 minutes will allow your brain to get the signal that more milk is needed."}
{"question": "What vaccines are given at 6 months?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a recommended vaccine schedule for 6 months. Vaccines can be spaced out or grouped.

{"question": "How can my partner help with labor pain?", "answer": "Reasoning: Labor will be painful. There are partner positions that can be used in early and active labor. There is a way to ask a partner for support during labor. There is a way to communicate to a partner that you don't want to be touched without being hurtful.\nAnswer: It is best to talk about what you would like during labor and delivery before the first day.  Making a birth plan together can give your partner a guide to go by so they can advocate for you during labor.  On the big day, your partner can help you with your relaxation techniques including deep breathing, help you into different positions to help ease the intense sensations of labor, and apply pressure or massage your lower back when asked.  A labor doula is also a wonderful idea.  A labor doula is a skilled birth partner that can do these things for you so your partner can focus on you emotionally."}
{"question": "Can you get post traumatic stress from labor?", "answer": "Reasoning: It is possible to feel upset or traumatized by a birth experience. There are resources available to help work through a birth experience after the fact. Feeling guilty for being upset about a birth experience is not necessary, even if the baby was born healthy. There are signs and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Labor may have been scary or difficult. Labor may not have gone as planned. The birth experience may create feelings that are hard to process.\nAnswer: Yes, PTSD from a traumatic labor experience is a real and distressing mental health concern in the postpartum period.  It is more common after a physically traumatic delivery or one is which emotionally scarring (feeling powerless, coerced, or scared with no reassurance).  Symptoms include intrusive thoughts of the event, anxiety or panic attacks, heightened arousal (difficulty sleeping, irritability, and overactive startle response), and feelings of detachment.  This condition is treatable with help from a therapist or mental health counselor.  Medication can also help depending on specific symptoms.  A vast majority of mental health medications are compatible with breastfeeding."}
{"question": "At what age do babies learn to control their arms?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies go through a typical sequence of gross motor development. There is an age at which babies typically learn to control their arms. There may be a reason to be concerned if my baby isn't controlling their arms by a certain age. Motor development changes with age. My baby may be developmentally ahead or behind in controlling their arms.\nAnswer: Infants typically begin to control their arms when their primitive reflexes start to fade.  These are the reflexes that babies are born with.  When these integrate, babies start to have control over their bodies.  Generally, we would expect an infant to have control over their arms starting at roughly 4 months of age.  Premature infants will take longer, but should have control by 6 months."}
{"question": "How long before my baby can sit up on her own?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies usually learn to sit independently at a certain age. There may be developmental milestones that need to be reached before a baby can sit on their own. There are things that can be done to support a baby's ability to sit on their own. There may be factors that can slow down a baby's development for sitting independently. My baby may be developmentally ahead or behind in sitting independently.\nAnswer: Fully sitting up on one's own takes time.  Starting at 4-6 months infants will generally start to tripod-sit, or sitting up while propped on their hands.  As time goes on, they will work towards moving their hands for brief periods and sitting independently.  In a full term infant with no developmental delays, it is expected that they will sit independently by 9 months of age."}
{"question": "What makes a childcare center a good fit for my family?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are different options for childcare available. Childcare centers can vary in their practices and offerings. There is a way to know if a childcare center is safe and licensed. There are factors that need to be considered when choosing childcare, such as cost, hours/availability, philosophy, academic offerings, location/accessibility, reputation, and provision of necessities.\nAnswer: After you make sure that the center is following the legal requirements of your state or territory as far as staffing and safety and is reputable, you can make a list of requirements.  After making a list of centers you are interested in, figure out a budget for care and check them with the tuition schedules listed on each centers website.  Once you narrow it down by cost, check on availability. Many care centers have waiting lists.  If cost is in line and there is availability, you will want to make sure that they have the hours you need, hopefully without additional costs.  At this point, you will want to make sure that the centers philosophies on early education, discipline, soothing and feeding are in line with your family's philosophies.  Taking a tour is imperative.  If you feel comfortable with the setting, questions about how the center handles illness, what their daily schedule is like and how they involve the parents in their care can help you find a good fit.  A direct referral from a trusted friend or family member is an excellent start."}
{"question": "How long do growth spurts last?", "answer": "Reasoning: Growth spurts have signs and symptoms. Growth spurts occur at a certain frequency. The frequency of growth spurts may change with age. There may be other possible causes for increased eating and sleeping. There is an age at which most children/teens stop growing.\nAnswer: Typical growth spurts in infants last for a few days, up to a week.  Signs of a growth spurt include: increase in appetite, fussiness, and changes in sleep patterns.  Infants tend to go through growth spurts every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly for the first year."}
{"question": "How to get my baby to crawl?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies usually start crawling at a certain age. There may be developmental milestones that need to be reached before a baby can crawl. There are things that can be done to support a baby's ability to crawl. There may be factors that can slow down a baby's development for crawling. Crawling earlier is considered better. I should be actively helping my baby learn to crawl.\nAnswer: Tummy time is the first step to encouraging your baby to crawl.  Starting at birth, you can do tummy time daily with your infant.  As they get older, you can encourage movement by having them reach for toys while in tummy time.  Once they are on hands and knees, making a safe obstacle course with pillows can encourage them to push off and go.  Always baby-proof your space and provide a safe landing for baby and let milestones come naturally.  Pushing them can slow them down."}
{"question": "Peeing more frequently is an indication for lightening?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are signs and symptoms of lightening. Frequent urination late in pregnancy may be caused by something specific. There are signs and symptoms of early labor.\nAnswer: Lightening, or the baby \"dropping\", refers to the phenomenon in the third trimester where the baby starts to settle into the pelvis to prepare for birth.  Due to more pressure on the bladder, peeing more frequently is often a sign that baby has dropped.  Other signs include an easier time breathing as baby moves out of your ribs, less heartburn and increased pressure on your pelvic floor."}
{"question": "Is swollen feet a sign of preeclampsia or just a sign for last trimester?", "answer": "Reasoning: Swollen feet could be a sign of preeclampsia. Late pregnancy may have different symptoms than earlier stages. There are signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. There is a way to differentiate preeclampsia from general late pregnancy swelling. There is a point at which medical attention should be sought for swelling.\nAnswer: Swollen feet are common in the third trimester.  If the swelling occurs after being on your feet for a long period of time and decreases when you rest and drink fluids, this is within normal limits.  If, however, the swelling is sudden, severe, includes your hands and face, and especially if you are experiencing tingling or numbness, call your midwife or obstetrician.  These are signs of preeclampsia.  If you are experiencing these symptoms along with a headache, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain, call your care provider immediately.  They will likely want you to be seen in the office or they will have you head to the emergency department if it is after hours."}
{"question": "How to manage clogged milk ducts?", "answer": "Reasoning: Clogged milk ducts can occur when breastfeeding. There is a way to know if I have a clogged duct. There may be potential dangers associated with having a clogged duct. There is a point at which I should seek medical attention for a clogged duct. There are ways to unclog a milk duct. There may be factors that can make a clogged duct worse.\nAnswer: Clogged milk ducts happen when inflammation is so great that milk cannot pass freely and the breasts cannot be drained.  The best preventative measure for clogged ducts is to feed early and often (at least every 2 to 3 hours from beginning of feed to beginning of feed in the first month) for at least 15-20 minutes per side.  If you are experiencing a tender lump or hard area on your breast, working on decreasing inflammation will allow the milk to release. Nursing or hand expressing instead of pumping with an electric pump is preferred as a pump can pull more lymph fluid into the breast, further exacerbating inflammation.  Very gentle massage, including lymphatic massage, during feeding sessions and ice for 15 minutes after each feed can help.  Heat, vibration, and deep massage are no longer recommended as they can make inflammation worse.  Anti-inflammatory medications such as advil are helpful if not medically contraindicated. Choline is the active ingredient in sunflower lecithin and it alone at a dose of 550 mg daily can help persistent clogs. Call an IBCLC if you can not remove any milk at all or are experiencing redness or warmth on the breast or a fever. These are signs of an infection."}
{"question": "How long before my baby can roll over ?", "answer": "Reasoning: Rolling over is a developmental milestone that babies reach at a certain age. There is an age at which babies usually start rolling over. There may be cause for concern if a baby is not rolling by a certain age. There are other developmental milestones that a baby needs to hit before being able to roll. There are things that can be done to support a baby's ability to roll. There may be factors that can slow down a baby's development for rolling. Babies may roll from belly to back or back to belly first. There may be a need for action if a baby rolls in their sleep.\nAnswer: Once your baby can lift their head, they will start to push up on their arms and lift their chest.  This movement strengthens their upper body and prepares them for rolling.  The usual order is that babies will roll from stomach to back first and then from back to stomach, though some do it in reverse and that is perfectly normal.  You can expect them to roll both ways by the end of their 6th month."}
{"question": "How can I help my toddler with being less stressed?", "answer": "Reasoning: Toddlers can experience stress. There are signs that indicate when a toddler is stressed. There are healthy outlets that can help a toddler with stress. Certain factors can create stress for toddlers, such as changes in routine or being tired/hungry. There are factors that can be changed to reduce the stress experienced by a toddler.\nAnswer: Modeling appropriate emotional responses in ourselves is the first step to helping our wee ones deal with the stressors of life.  Little ones look to us as an example of how to act. While moderling good emotional health, teaching your toddler skills to handle their big emotions is key to helping them feel less stressed.  Regulating, relate and reason is a model that can help.  First help them to regulate their emotions by making sure they are safe, helping them name what emotion they are feeling, and staying calm.  Next, relate to them.  Telling them that their emotions are ok and that you understood can help to de-escalate situations.  Finally, when they are regulated and feeling safe, you can try to reason with them by walking them through what happened and what they can do next time.  If you are having a hard time regulating them, the acronym PHALT can be helpful.  Potty, hungry, angry, lonely, and tired are the precursors to meltdowns a lot of the time."}
{"question": "How do I know if I'm diluted or effaced?", "answer": "Reasoning: Dilating and effacing are signs of labor. There are signs and symptoms of early labor. There is a progression to labor and there are signs of progression. It may take a certain amount of time to be fully dilated and effaced.\nAnswer: The only way to know if you are dilated or effaced is via an internal exam.  Your body will give you a few clues though.  The biggest clue that you are beginning to dilate and efface is losing your mucus plug.  Your mucous plug is formed at the opening of your cervix during pregnancy and as the cervix begins to dilate, it can come away.  Some people notice an increase in discharge, especially if it is pink or tinged with blood (also known as bloody show).  Some people lose the plug all at once, noticing a thick, gelatinous piece upon wiping. Once in heavy labor, a dark line can sometimes be seen on fair skinned people in the crevice of the buttocks when they are fully dilated."}
{"question": "Does the heartburn indicate that the baby grows hair in the womb?", "answer": "Reasoning: There may be a belief that certain symptoms in pregnancy can indicate different outcomes for the baby. There may be hormones in pregnancy that can cause both heartburn and hair growth. It can be difficult to differentiate between old wives' tales and factual information in pregnancy.\nAnswer: Once an old wives tale, the idea that increased heartburn means that a baby will be born with hair has some potential merit.  It is not the heartburn that causes the hair to grow though, but an excessive surge of hormones.  This surge causes the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, increasing heartburn.  This same increase in hormones seems to be linked to more hair growth in the baby.  Of course this is only if it is due to hormones.  Heartburn from diet or pre-existing conditions will not have the same effect."}
{"question": "How do I clean an infants nose?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are safe ways to keep a baby's nose and sinuses clear. There are factors that can cause a baby's nose to be congested. I should keep my infant's nose clean and clear.\nAnswer: It is not necessary to clean inside baby's nose if they are not stuffy.  Wiping the outside of the nostrils gently with a warm washcloth will suffice.  If they are stuffy, you can help clear their mucus with a bulb syringe and saline.  After placing 2 drops of saline into the nostril, squeeze the bulb syringe to expel air.  Insert the tip into the nostril (1/4 inch in), block the other nostril, and release the bulb.  Mucus will be suctioned into the bulb.  Empty the bulb by squeezing it rapidly into a tissue.  Repeat on the other side.  Always clean the syringe with hot water and soap afterwards."}
{"question": "Why does my baby cry while sleeping?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies may experience discomfort while sleeping. Babies can have bad dreams while sleeping. There are common reasons for a baby to cry while sleeping. There is a way to comfort a baby who is crying while sleeping.\nAnswer: Babies cry while they are sleeping for a number of reasons.  Hunger, being cold, wet/soiled or generally uncomfortable are common reasons.   Another reason is what pediatricians refer to as confusional arousal.  This is when a baby might cry or look frightened but be completely asleep, calling out with a cry as they move between sleep cycles.  This is nothing to worry about and is common.  Always check on a crying baby to make sure that they are in a safe sleeping position, have a clean, dry diaper and are well fed."}
{"question": "How much sleep do newborns need?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a typical amount of sleep per day for a newborn. There is a point at which too much or too little sleep may be a concern. There are potential actions to take if a baby is sleeping too much or too little.\nAnswer: Newborns will sleep up to 17 hours a day, often times in one to two hour increments.  By the time they are 4 months, they should sleep between 12-16 hours a day usually in the form of longer stretches at night and between 2-3 naps during the day."}
{"question": "What should I do if my baby flips over during sleep?", "answer": "Reasoning: It may not be safe for a baby to roll over while sleeping. There may be risks associated with a baby rolling over while sleeping. There is a recommended sleeping position for babies. There may be a need to move the baby back to their original sleeping position. If a baby can roll both ways, there may be a concern about them sleeping on their belly.\nAnswer: According to the National Institute of Health and the American Academy of Pediatrics, an infant that can flip themselves over during sleep is developmentally advanced enough to protect their airway.  As long as your baby is being placed down on their back to sleep and can independently roll themselves, there is no concern.  You can help baby to develop this skill with tummy time.  Always put a baby to sleep on their back to decreased the risk of SIUD"}
{"question": "How much food should I feed my 1 year old?", "answer": "Reasoning: There are average nutritional needs for a one year old in terms of calories and food groups. There is a way to know if a baby is getting enough to eat. There may be a concern about feeding a one year old too much. There are specific foods that a one year old should consume. My baby may be eating too much or not enough.\nAnswer: Once your baby is one year old, you can wean from formula under the guidance of your pediatrician.  Follow up or toddler formulas are not necessary according to new studies.  Breastfed babies can continue to nurse for as long as is desired by both the toddler and parent.  If transitioning to cow's milk, the general guideline is 2-3 cups (8 oz each) of whole milk daily.  Meals should include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, fats and proteins in the form of 4-5 meals per day. 1 cup of food per meal total is within normal limits for this age."}
{"question": "What do babies learn in utero?", "answer": "Reasoning: Babies are able to sense input while in utero. There is some motor development that occurs in utero. Babies may be born with prior knowledge acquired in utero, such as recognizing their mother's voice.\nAnswer: Research has shown that babies have many sensory developments while in utero.  It has been shown that they learn sensations of touch, pressure, and temperature, can learn distinct voices, and can taste different foods as they flavor the amniotic fluid.  After a landmark study on babies showing a preference for stories that they heard when they were in utero, it is recommended to talk to, sing, and play music to your little one while you are pregnant."}
{"question": "Will my baby start to sleep longer after 2 months?", "answer": "Reasoning: Sleep patterns for newborns change in the first 3 months. There is a way to know if my baby is getting enough sleep. There are things I can do to help my baby sleep for longer stretches. Babies may start sleeping for longer stretches at a certain age. There may be sleep regressions that occur at certain ages.\nAnswer: While it is possible for infants to sleep for longer durations once they are back to their birth weight and feeding has been well established, it is not common for infants under 6 months to sleep longer than 4-5 hour stretches at a time.  Sleep has many variables including each particular infants metabolism, reflexes, weight, gestational age when they were born, and feeding norms.  At 2 months, the average infant is sleeping 15 hours a day, with 9 to 10 of those hours at night, usually in chunks of 3-5 hours at a time."}
{"question": "Is it normal for baby to move more in the 9th month?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a normal amount of movement that a baby should have in late pregnancy. There may be cause for concern if a baby is moving more or less than before. There may be a need to track the movement of the baby. There may be factors that can cause a baby to move more or less in late pregnancy. My baby might not be moving enough.\nAnswer: As the fetus grows larger, there is less room to move around.  The average movement pattern in the last months of pregnancy are 10 kicks every hour or two, with periods of calm and periods of higher activity. Movement tends to be strong, concentrated kicks or slow broad movements of the body while stretching.  An infant that moves a lot is not necessarily a concern if this is a consistent pattern and you have talked to your midwife or obstetrician.  An increase in movement that does not decrease at rest or a change in frequency can be a sign that baby needs to be checked on, so call your care provider."}
{"question": "How do I push the baby out?", "answer": "Reasoning: My body may have knowledge of how to deliver a baby. There may be a way to know when it is time to push. There may be a situation where I am unable to deliver my baby.\nAnswer: Once you reach 10 cm, if all is well, it is helpful to wait until you feel the urge to push.  The pushing phase is the most stressful for the infant, so it is helpful to shorten the phase by waiting until the body is ready.  Once you feel the urge to push (which might feel like you need to produce a bowel movement), push in whatever way feels natural as the urge comes.  It is not necessary to sustain pushing for long periods or to hold one's breath as this can tire you out and cause distress in the baby.  Once the urge to push leaves, rest and breathe deeply before the next urge comes.  Being upright or on hands and knees can help as gravity will assist the baby in coming down."}
{"question": "What should I bring to the hospital?", "answer": "Reasoning: There is a specific length of time that I will be in the hospital. There are specific activities that I will be doing while in the hospital. There may be a need to leave the room and go to other areas of the hospital. The hospital may not provide items like soap or shampoo.\nAnswer: The arrival of your new son or daughter is a time of excitement and joy. It is often also a hectic time, so it can be hard to remember to pack everything that you will need at the hospital. About a month before your baby's due date, make sure you have the items below. Pack as many beforehand as you can. Use this checklist as a guide to get organized for the big event."}

It is crucial for women to abstain from drinking alcohol if they are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or think they might be pregnant. Even small amounts of alcohol can be harmful to a developing fetus and increase the risk of miscarriage."}
{"question": "What is postpartum?", "answer": "The time that begins right after a woman gives birth and lasts about 6 weeks."}
{"question": "What are long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs)?", "answer": "Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are a category of highly effective birth control methods designed to provide prolonged contraception with minimal maintenance. They include various types such as intrauterine devices (IUDs), which are small devices placed inside the uterus; injectables, which are hormone shots administered every few months; implants, which are tiny rods inserted under the skin that release hormones; contraceptive patches, which stick to the skin and release hormones into the bloodstream; and vaginal rings, which are placed inside the vagina and release hormones locally. LARCs are reversible, meaning that fertility typically returns promptly after discontinuation, making them a flexible option for those seeking long-term, but not permanent, contraception."}
{"question": "What are the benefits of using LARCs?", "answer": "LARCs offer numerous benefits, making them a popular choice for those seeking reliable and hassle-free contraception. These methods are highly effective in preventing pregnancy, with a success rate of over 99%. Once in place, they provide long-term protection ranging from several months to several years, depending on the type, without requiring daily attention or frequent visits to a healthcare provider. LARCs are also cost-effective over time, as they eliminate the need for ongoing purchases of contraceptive supplies. They can be initiated immediately after childbirth or an abortion, offering convenience and reducing the risk of unintended pregnancy. Importantly, LARCs allow for a quick return to fertility once they are removed or discontinued, making them a suitable option for individuals planning future pregnancies."}
{"question": "Is it true that IUDs cause infections, particularly pelvic inflammatory disease?", "answer": "No, it is a myth that IUDs cause infections, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). When an IUD is inserted correctly by a healthcare provider, the risk of infection is very low. The risk of developing PID is primarily associated with existing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at the time of insertion, rather than the IUD itself."}
{"question": "Do IUDs increase the risk of cancer?", "answer": "No, IUDs do not increase the risk of cancer. This is a common misconception. In fact, some hormonal IUDs may even lower the risk of certain types of cancer, such as endometrial cancer. Extensive studies have shown that there is no direct link between IUDs and an increased risk of cancer."}
{"question": "Is it true that IUDs cause heavy bleeding and painful periods?", "answer": "While it is possible for some users to experience heavier bleeding or more painful periods after getting a copper IUD, these effects usually diminish over time. Hormonal IUDs, on the other hand, often result in lighter periods or even no periods at all. Any changes in menstrual cycles are generally temporary and can vary from person to person."}
{"question": "Can IUDs move around the body or become embedded in other organs?", "answer": "No, this is a myth. IUDs are designed to stay securely in place within the uterus. While it is extremely rare, an IUD can occasionally shift slightly or become displaced, but it does not move around the body or embed itself in other organs. Regular check-ups can ensure that the IUD remains correctly positioned."}
{"question": "Do IUDs delay fertility after removal?", "answer": "No, IUDs do not delay fertility after removal. This is a common misconception. Fertility typically returns to normal very quickly once the IUD is removed, allowing those who wish to conceive to do so without significant delay."}
{"question": "Do IUDs reduce sexual desire or pleasure?", "answer": "No, there is no evidence that IUDs reduce sexual desire or pleasure. This is a myth. Most users do not notice the presence of the IUD during intercourse, and it does not interfere with sexual function. Any concerns in this area are usually psychological rather than physical."}
{"question": "How long do different types of LARCs last?", "answer": "The duration of effectiveness for different types of LARCs varies based on the specific method. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) come in two main types: copper and hormonal. Copper IUDs can last between 10 to 12 years, providing long-term contraception without hormones. Hormonal IUDs typically last between 3 to 7 years, depending on the brand and hormone dosage. Contraceptive implants, which are small rods inserted under the skin, generally provide protection for up to 3 years. Injectable contraceptives, administered every few months, require regular visits to a healthcare provider for continued effectiveness. Contraceptive patches and vaginal rings are not classified as long-acting but provide effective contraception when used consistently (patches are replaced weekly, and rings are replaced monthly). Each method offers a different balance between longevity and maintenance, allowing individuals to choose based on their lifestyle and reproductive goals."}
{"question": "Does eating saffron during pregnancy result in a fairer-skinned baby?", "answer": "This is a common misconception. There is no scientific evidence that consuming saffron during pregnancy affects the baby's skin color."}

{"question": "Do your baby’s movements slow down closer to its due date?", "answer": "You may feel your baby’s movements as anything from a kick or a flutter, to a roll or a swish. If your baby’s movement pattern changes—the routine, strength, or frequency—it may be a sign that it is unwell. There is no set number of normal movements. It is NOT TRUE that babies move less or slow down towards the end of your pregnancy. You should continue to feel your baby’s regular movement patterns right up to the time of its birth. The myth that having something to eat or a cold drink to stimulate your baby does NOT work. Trust your intuition and if you are concerned about your baby’s movements, contact your doctor or midwife immediately."}
{"question": "Is lying on your back dangerous when you are pregnant?", "answer": "The best position to sleep when you are pregnant, particularly after 28 weeks, is on your side. It is not a good idea to lie flat on your back, as the weight of your baby and uterus presses down on some major veins that carry blood back to the heart. This may make you feel short of breath or light-headed, and lead to lower oxygen levels in the baby, compromising the baby’s wellbeing. Recent studies have shown that women who go to sleep on their back have up to an 8 times higher chance of having a stillborn baby compared to women who go to sleep in another position. Use pillows behind your back and between your knees to prevent falling on your back."}
{"question": "Can exercise during pregnancy harm the baby or cause premature labour?", "answer": "There are many benefits to regular exercise during pregnancy, including physical benefits and prevention of excessive weight gain, as well as psychological wellbeing.

{"question": "What happens during the first trimester?", "answer": "In the first trimester, from conception to 14 weeks, the embryo undergoes significant development. At 5 weeks, the heart starts to beat. By 7 weeks, the head is larger than the rest of the body, arms and fingers begin to form, and eyes become visible. By 10 weeks, the embryo looks more human, with distinguishable facial features and forming toes and fingers. At this stage, the embryo is now a fetus, with all body parts in place but still growing and developing."}
{"question": "What happens between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy?", "answer": "Between 10 and 14 weeks, the fetus grows larger, and skeletal bones begin to form. By 14 weeks, the fetus measures around 8.5 cm. While the genitals are not fully formed, they are developed enough to determine the sex of the baby. An ultrasound between 16 and 18 weeks can typically confirm the baby's sex."}
{"question": "What happens between 15 and 28 weeks of pregnancy?", "answer": "During the second trimester (15-28 weeks), your baby undergoes significant growth and development. At 16 weeks, the head is still large, but the trunk, arms, and legs begin to lengthen. By 20 weeks, you can feel the baby's movements. The baby is coated in vernix caseosa, a protective cream. At 22 weeks, the baby measures around 19 cm, and hair growth begins along with lanugo, a fine fuzz. Between 23-27 weeks, the baby gains weight, and at 24 weeks, they can hear low-frequency sounds.

{"question": "How do pregnancy-related changes affect the heart, blood vessels, and lungs?", "answer": "During pregnancy, your heart rate may increase by up to 10 beats per minute, and your heart shifts slightly within your rib cage to accommodate the growing baby and expanding uterus. The volume of your blood increases to meet the fetus's needs. Pregnancy can also affect your breathing, causing mild shortness of breath, which usually starts gradually and remains mild. This is due to the physical changes happening in your body to support the pregnancy."}
{"question": "What hair changes might occur during pregnancy?", "answer": "During pregnancy, many women experience changes in hair growth. Some may notice increased body hair and a thicker, fuller head of hair. However, a few months after giving birth, it is common to experience more hair loss than usual as the body returns to its pre-pregnancy hormonal balance."}
{"question": "How does pregnancy affect the skin?", "answer": "Pregnancy can cause various skin changes due to hormonal fluctuations. These may include changes in skin tone, the appearance of stretch marks, or increased oiliness or dryness of the skin and scalp. While these changes can be noticeable, they are usually temporary and should diminish or disappear after the baby is born."}
{"question": "What causes hyperpigmentation during pregnancy, and how does it affect the skin?", "answer": "Hyperpigmentation is a common condition during pregnancy where the skin darkens in certain areas. This can manifest as a dark line between the belly button and pubis, as well as darkening of the perineum, anus, neck, armpits, areolae, or around the belly button. The \"pregnancy mask\" or melasma results in brown patches on the face due to hyperpigmentation. Sun exposure can aggravate these conditions, so it's important to use sunscreen. These skin changes generally clear up after childbirth and usually disappear within a year."}
{"question": "Where do stretch marks appear during pregnancy, and how can they be managed?", "answer": "Stretch marks often develop during the second half of pregnancy, primarily on the tummy, breasts, thighs, armpits, lower back, buttocks, and arms. They occur when the deeper layer of skin stretches as the body changes. Initially, stretch marks may appear pinkish or purple, but they gradually fade over time. While there is no proven method to prevent or treat stretch marks effectively, massaging moisturizing cream into the skin may help reduce their appearance. However, the ingredients in the cream seem to have minimal impact on the marks themselves."}
{"question": "What other skin changes can occur during pregnancy?", "answer": "During pregnancy, some women may experience additional skin changes, such as acne, which usually clears up after birth. Hormonal changes can also lead to the development of acrochordons, or skin tags—small, benign growths typically found in skin folds like the neck and armpits. Another common occurrence is the formation of angiomas, which are small red patches on the skin caused by blood vessels. Angiomas typically develop between the second and fifth months of pregnancy but usually fade within three months after giving birth."}
{"question": "How does pregnancy affect bladder and kidney function?", "answer": "During pregnancy, both bladder and kidney function undergo changes. The kidneys increase in volume and filter more liquid, which can lead to a more frequent or urgent need to urinate. As the pregnancy progresses and the uterus expands, it places more pressure on the bladder, intensifying this urge. Additionally, many pregnant women experience increased urination at night. During the day, the body tends to retain water, which is redistributed to the kidneys when lying down, prompting more frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom."}
{"question": "What digestive changes occur during pregnancy?", "answer": "During pregnancy, hormonal changes often slow down digestion, which can lead to discomfort. The slowing of digestion is commonly associated with heartburn, caused by the relaxation of the valve between the stomach and esophagus, allowing stomach acid to rise. Constipation also becomes a common issue as the digestive system works more slowly, and the growing uterus puts pressure on the intestines. These changes can result in discomfort, but they are common and typically subside after the pregnancy."}
{"question": "What changes occur in the breasts during pregnancy?", "answer": "During pregnancy, your breasts undergo several changes as they prepare for breastfeeding. Sensitivity and an increase in size are common, and blue veins may become more visible. The nipples and areolas also grow slightly and may darken, with bumps forming on the areolas. These bumps are glands that produce oil to keep the skin moisturized. Around 16 weeks, your breasts begin producing colostrum, the first milk for your baby, and some women may experience colostrum leakage, which is completely normal."}
{"question": "How does pregnancy affect the uterus and posture?", "answer": "Before pregnancy, your uterus is about the size of a small pear. As pregnancy progresses, it expands to accommodate the growing fetus and changes in shape and position within the abdomen. The increasing weight of the uterus shifts your center of gravity forward, which can lead to changes in posture. This is why some women notice that they walk differently during pregnancy compared to before."}
{"question": "What changes occur in vaginal discharge during pregnancy?", "answer": "During pregnancy, women often experience increased vaginal discharge due to hormonal changes. The discharge is typically whitish in color, slick, and odorless. This is a normal occurrence and usually not a cause for concern unless it changes in color, odor, or consistency."}
{"question": "How do ligaments and joints change during pregnancy?", "answer": "During pregnancy, hormonal changes cause the ligaments supporting your joints to gradually loosen, particularly in the pelvic area. This can result in pain, especially during physical activity, and in some cases, even while resting. This is a common discomfort that many women experience as their body prepares for childbirth."}
{"question": "Why do women accumulate fat reserves during pregnancy?", "answer": "During pregnancy, women accumulate fat reserves, primarily in the tummy, back, and thighs. These reserves store energy and are essential for supporting the pregnancy and ensuring that breastfeeding goes smoothly after childbirth. This fat storage helps provide the necessary nutrients and energy for both the growing baby and the mother's body during this time."}
{"question": "Why do women gain weight during pregnancy?", "answer": "Weight gain during pregnancy is a natural process as the body changes to support the growing baby. The weight gain includes the weight of the baby, the uterus, the placenta, and the amniotic fluid. Additionally, the body stores fat reserves for energy, and there is an increase in blood volume and extravascular fluids. All these factors contribute to the overall weight gain necessary for the health of both the mother and the baby during pregnancy."}
{"question": "Why is weight gain during pregnancy important?", "answer": "Weight gain during pregnancy is essential for the health of both the mother and the baby, as it supports the growth and development of the fetus. However, it’s not just about gaining weight; maintaining a healthy diet and engaging in regular physical activity are also crucial factors. A balanced diet ensures that both you and your baby receive the necessary nutrients, while physical activity helps maintain overall health and well-being throughout the pregnancy."}
{"question": "How much weight should you gain during pregnancy?", "answer": "Weight gain during pregnancy is gradual and varies for each woman. During the first trimester, the gain is typically between 500g to 2kg (1 to 4.5 lbs), while the second and third trimesters see more substantial growth, with women typically gaining 225 to 500g (1/2 to 1 lb) per week. However, this can differ depending on factors like pre-pregnancy weight and whether the woman is carrying multiple babies. Regular monitoring by a prenatal care provider is crucial, so there's no need to weigh yourself at home unless advised. If you have concerns about your weight gain, it's important to discuss them with your care provider."}
{"question": "Some women embrace the changes, viewing them as signs of the baby's development, while others may struggle with accepting their new body image, especially given the discomfort and symptoms of pregnancy.", "answer": "It's important to give yourself time to adjust to these changes, as they are a testament to your body's incredible ability to nurture and bring new life. If you're feeling discomfort or dissatisfaction, it's helpful to talk to someone you trust."}
{"question": "The emotional impact of pregnancy can vary, as women adjust to new realities, including the expectations of motherhood and the arrival of the baby.", "answer": "It's important to take the time to adapt to these changes and give yourself the space to process the emotional and psychological shifts that come with preparing for a new chapter in life."}
{"question": "Emotional fluctuations during pregnancy are common, and it is important to allow yourself to feel these emotions without suppressing them.", "answer": "Acknowledge your emotions as they arise, rather than trying to fight them. It is natural to experience a mix of feelings, and embracing them is part of the process of navigating pregnancy."}
{"question": "Talking about your emotions helps you realize you are not alone and can offer support through shared experiences.", "answer": "Talking to those close to you or connecting with other pregnant women can provide comfort and support. Keep in mind that every woman and pregnancy is different, and your emotions are valid, even if they don’t align with those of others."}
{"question": "Seeking support, setting boundaries, and managing emotions are key to coping with pregnancy changes.", "answer": "To adapt to emotional changes, engage in activities like walking or meditating. Talk to trusted people or your prenatal care provider for support. Set boundaries for unsolicited comments and seek help if experiencing depression symptoms."}
{"question": "Building a relationship with the baby, seeking support, and preparing for fatherhood.", "answer": "Attend prenatal appointments, interact with your partner’s belly, and engage in conversations with other expectant fathers to understand and embrace your new role. Participating in prenatal sessions can boost your confidence in your abilities as a parent."}
{"question": "Navigating changes in relationship dynamics, expressing emotions, and strengthening the partnership.", "answer": "Open communication is crucial for both partners to express fears, concerns, and emotions. Maintaining a strong relationship foundation will help both navigate the transition to parenthood together and remain united in their shared journey."}
{"question": "Balancing attention among children, addressing emotional concerns, involving siblings in pregnancy preparations.", "answer": "Pregnancy can bring mixed emotions for older children, from jealousy to confusion. To help them adjust, provide reassurance, involve them in preparations, and continue to show affection to ensure they feel loved and included in the changes."}
{"question": "Fluctuations in sexual desire, physical and emotional changes affecting intimacy, exploring new forms of closeness.", "answer": "Pregnancy can lead to changes in sexual desire and intimacy. Couples may experience varying levels of sexual satisfaction due to physical discomfort, emotional shifts, or personal boundaries. It's important to communicate openly, adapt to each other's needs, and explore new ways of intimacy to maintain a healthy relationship."}
{"question": "Medical restrictions, prenatal care provider guidance, precautions to ensure safety during pregnancy.", "answer": "In certain cases, your prenatal care provider may advise against sexual intercourse, particularly if there are complications like bleeding, abdominal pain, or concerns about premature labor. It's important to follow their guidance and take any necessary precautions for the safety of both you and your baby."}
{"question": "Safe sex practices, condom use to prevent STIs, preventing complications during pregnancy.", "answer": "It is essential to protect yourself from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during pregnancy. If there is a risk of exposure, using a condom can help prevent the transmission of infections, thereby safeguarding both your health and the health of your baby."}
{"question": "Usage of non-medicated products, checking with healthcare providers for medicated creams.", "answer": "Most cosmetics, including face creams and hand and body lotions without medicinal ingredients, are safe to use during pregnancy. However, if you're using a medicated cream, it is advisable to consult your doctor or pharmacist to ensure it is safe to continue using it while pregnant."}
{"question": "Hair treatments are generally safe, but workplace exposure should be discussed with a healthcare provider.", "answer": "Hair products and treatments, including dyes, colouring shampoos, highlights, and perms, are generally safe for pregnant women and their fetus. However, if you are exposed to these products regularly as part of your work, it is advisable to discuss the matter with your healthcare professional."}
{"question": "Use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher to prevent hyperpigmentation and pregnancy mask.", "answer": "It is recommended to use sunscreen when going out in the sun during pregnancy, as sun exposure can increase the risk of hyperpigmentation and pregnancy mask. Choose a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 that protects against both UVA and UVB rays. Pay special attention to protecting your face."}
{"question": "Use DEET, icaridin, or soybean oil-based repellents, ensuring proper concentrations.", "answer": "If you need to use insect repellent during pregnancy, choose one with DEET, icaridin, or soybean oil. DEET- and icaridin-based products protect against both mosquitoes and ticks, while soybean oil-based products only protect against mosquitoes. Ensure that the DEET concentration does not exceed 30%, icaridin is no more than 20%, and soybean oil is no more than 2%. Always read the label for protection duration and reapply only as needed."}
{"question": "Apply product to exposed skin, wash off excess.", "answer": "While there is no scientific evidence that insect repellents pose a risk to the baby, it is important to apply the repellent only to exposed skin and to wash off any excess product."}
{"question": "Apply to clothes, wear protective clothing.", "answer": "To reduce exposure to insect repellents, consider applying them to your clothes instead of directly on your skin. Additionally, wearing long pants and light-colored clothing can help protect against insect bites."}
{"question": "Short-term effect, frequent reapplication, exposure.", "answer": "The use of citronella oil or lavender oil–based products during pregnancy is not recommended. These oils have short-term effects, requiring frequent reapplication, which can lead to increased exposure."}
{"question": "Lack of scientific studies, precautionary advice.", "answer": "There have been no scientific studies on the risk of electrolysis and laser hair removal for pregnant women and their unborn babies. As a precaution, it is recommended that you avoid these hair removal methods until after you give birth."}
{"question": "Ultraviolet rays, body temperature, potential harm to the baby.", "answer": "Even though ultraviolet rays cannot reach the fetus, tanning salons are not recommended for pregnant women. The extreme heat you are exposed to during tanning sessions can significantly increase body temperature and harm your baby. Many tanning salons require pregnant customers to provide written authorization from a health professional."}
{"question": "Physical and mental well-being, energy, back pain, gestational diabetes, recovery after birth.", "answer": "Being physically active during pregnancy is good for your physical and mental well-being. Women who are active during pregnancy cope better with the physical changes of pregnancy, have more energy, and are less short of breath. Practicing regular and varied physical activities throughout pregnancy is beneficial and safe. It prevents and relieves constipation, eases back pain, and prevents certain pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes. Better physical fitness may also help you recover more easily after giving birth."}
{"question": "Small quantities of physical activity, gradual increase, 150 minutes per week, moderate intensity.", "answer": "Physical activity, even in small quantities, is good for your pregnancy! If you’re not used to being active in your everyday life, start slowly and gradually add more. Getting around on foot, going for walks, and playing with your kids are some of the activities you can work into your daily routine. Pregnant women can aim for a total of 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activities per week, spread over several days. Moderate intensity means you can talk while exercising, but you can’t sing."}
{"question": "Adaptation based on fitness level, stage of pregnancy, and personal comfort.", "answer": "Choose your activities based on your fitness level and what you feel like doing. You can continue many of the activities you enjoyed before becoming pregnant. However, you may have to adapt some of them depending on your stage of pregnancy. For example, you can reduce the intensity or change certain movements. Sports like power walking, swimming, aquafitness, stationary biking, and snowshoeing are examples of activities you can do. You can also add strength and mobility exercises, yoga, and gentle stretching to your daily routine. Fatigue and some discomforts of pregnancy may prevent you from being as active as you like, especially at the beginning and end of your pregnancy. Listen to your body, exercise less intensely, or get some rest, then resume physical activity when it’s comfortable for you."}
{"question": "Avoiding risky activities and respecting personal limits.", "answer": "Don’t worry—exercise doesn’t increase the risk of miscarriage or harm to your baby. Your prenatal care provider will tell you if your health situation prevents physical activities. However, activities like scuba diving, sports with risk of falls, physical contact, impacts, or injury, are not recommended. It's also best to avoid sit-ups, activities in hot or humid environments, or those at high altitudes (above 2,500 m). Listen to your body and respect your limits."}
{"question": "Adjusting activity level or seeking advice when discomfort occurs.", "answer": "If you experience discomfort like shortness of breath, urinary leakage, or vaginal heaviness during physical activity, reduce intensity or switch activities. Consult your prenatal care provider if you’re unsure or feel incapable of participating in physical activities. Women athletes who wish to continue intensive training during pregnancy should do so under medical supervision."}
{"question": "No safe level of cigarette use; advised to quit smoking during pregnancy.", "answer": "Pregnancy is an ideal time to quit smoking. Smoking, including exposure to second-hand smoke, harms the fetus, mother, and baby, with no safe level of tobacco use. Prenatal care providers will ask about smoking habits to provide relevant care, support quitting, and address concerns. Smoking affects fetal development and can complicate pregnancy and the postpartum period."}
{"question": "Smoking increases risk for complications such as preterm birth, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).", "answer": "Smoking during pregnancy significantly harms fetal development and increases risks such as placental abruption, premature birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). To reduce these risks, it's important to avoid second-hand smoke. Pregnant women should encourage friends and family who smoke to do so outdoors to prevent exposure."}
{"question": "Reducing or quitting smoking benefits both the mother and baby, with various resources available for support.", "answer": "It's never too late to quit smoking during pregnancy. Even if you quit later in your pregnancy, your baby will still benefit. Since smoking is often an addiction, reducing the number of cigarettes can be a first step toward quitting. Speak to your healthcare provider for guidance. Free services like the iQuitnow helpline (1-866-527-7383) and tobacco-free centers can offer support in your journey to quit."}
{"question": "E-cigarettes are not recommended during pregnancy due to limited research on their safety. Safer alternatives are available for those looking to quit smoking.", "answer": "The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, vapes) is not recommended during pregnancy due to limited research on their effects on both the mother and fetus. If you are pregnant and want to quit smoking, there are safer and more effective alternatives. Speak to a healthcare professional for guidance on quitting tobacco safely."}
{"question": "Pregnant women are advised against drinking alcohol, as even small amounts can harm the baby.", "answer": "Pregnant women are advised not to consume alcohol at any point during pregnancy. Even small amounts of alcohol can have harmful effects, and the more alcohol consumed, the greater the potential harm to the developing baby. This includes all types of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and spirits. Binge drinking and regular consumption are particularly harmful."}
{"question": "Alcohol during pregnancy can cause significant harm to the fetus.", "answer": "Alcohol can have numerous harmful effects during pregnancy, including increasing the risk of miscarriage, hypertension, and placental abnormalities. It can also negatively affect the development of organs in the fetus, leading to birth defects and health problems. The brain is especially vulnerable to alcohol exposure, and damage to the baby's brain can lead to learning and behavioral disorders that may affect the child throughout their life. Since the placenta does not filter alcohol, it is recommended not to drink alcohol at any stage of pregnancy, including all trimesters. If you have consumed alcohol during pregnancy or before knowing you were pregnant, it's important to consult your health professional."}
{"question": "Supportive actions to maintain a healthy pregnancy.", "answer": "It’s important to explain to your partner, family, and friends that you need to avoid alcohol during pregnancy, as their support will be crucial. You can also use your pregnancy as an opportunity to try out non-alcoholic beverages, such as sparkling water with fruit or cucumber slices, homemade iced tea, or virgin (alcohol-free) versions of your favorite cocktails (mocktails). Most bars and restaurants offer mocktail options, so don’t hesitate to ask your server.

{"question": "Advisories against using cannabis during pregnancy.", "answer": "Pregnant women are strongly advised not to use cannabis or expose themselves to second-hand cannabis smoke. Cannabis can interfere with fetal growth, leading to lower birth weight, and may also affect brain development in the baby, which could cause developmental issues in childhood and adolescence. The harmful effects of cannabis are present regardless of the method of use—whether smoked, vaped, eaten, or consumed in any other form. While cannabis might relieve nausea in some individuals, it is not considered a safe solution for pregnant women."}
{"question": "Warnings against drug use and recommendations for support.", "answer": "Pregnant women are strongly advised not to use any drugs, as their effects on an unborn baby can vary based on the type of drug, the amount consumed, its potency, and the timing and method of use. Additionally, drugs purchased on the black market may contain harmful substances that increase the risks. For instance, cocaine can lead to bleeding, placental detachment, or even death of the fetus, as well as premature birth. Babies born to mothers who used drugs may experience withdrawal symptoms. If you have concerns or need assistance with drug use during pregnancy, it's important to talk to your health professional or contact a support service like Drogs, Help, and Referral at 514-527-2626 or 1-800-265-2626, or visit aidedrogue.ca/en/."}
{"question": "Recommendations for using cleaning products safely during pregnancy.", "answer": "Pregnant women can generally use common household cleaning products like dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, window cleaner, and all-purpose cleaners safely. However, corrosive products like bleach and oven cleaners can irritate the respiratory system and may cause burns if not handled properly, though they do not pose harm to the baby when inhaled in low concentrations. It's important to use heavy-duty cleaning products and air fresheners with caution, as they may release toxic substances. Always read and follow the instructions on product labels to ensure safety."}
{"question": "Recommendations for safely using paint and paint removers during pregnancy.", "answer": "Most interior paints are latex-based, meaning they are water-thinned and generally considered safe for occasional use during pregnancy. However, oil-based paints should be avoided as they contain harmful solvents that can affect the fetus. It is unlikely that brief exposure to freshly painted rooms will harm your baby, especially if the area is well-ventilated. To minimize risk, avoid stripping paint with sanders or paint removers, as this can expose you to lead from old paint or toxic chemicals in paint removers."}
{"question": "Recommendations to reduce the risk of toxoplasmosis from cats during pregnancy.", "answer": "While having a cat during pregnancy is generally safe, pregnant women should take precautions to avoid exposure to the toxoplasma parasite, which cats can carry. The parasite can be found in cat feces, especially if the cat has eaten contaminated meat. To minimize risk, have someone else clean the litter box. If that's not possible, wear plastic gloves, wash them thoroughly after use, and wash your hands well afterward. Clean the litter box daily, as parasites need 1 to 5 days to become infectious."}
{"question": "Recommendations to avoid exposure to toxoplasmosis while gardening.", "answer": "When gardening during pregnancy, it’s important to wear gloves to avoid contact with soil or sand that may be contaminated with toxoplasma from animals, including cats.

{"question": "Questions often arise such as, \"Does my insurance cover hospital stays and childbirth in another country?\" or \"Am I and my baby insured while traveling abroad?\"", "answer": "Before traveling abroad during pregnancy, ensure that your insurance policy covers medical expenses in the event of hospitalization or childbirth, including for your baby. This coverage is especially critical in cases of premature birth, where intensive care can incur significant costs. While Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec reimburses the equivalent cost of care in Québec, medical expenses abroad may be higher, and you could face a substantial bill if you and your baby are not adequately insured. Always confirm coverage with your insurer before departure."}
{"question": "Women often ask, \"What should I eat during pregnancy?\" or \"How can I make my meals more nutritious for my pregnancy?\"", "answer": "Eating well during pregnancy is about making mindful choices that include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and protein-rich foods, especially plant-based options. This not only supports your health but also contributes to your baby’s development. Experimenting with new flavors, varying cooking methods, and sharing meals with others can make healthy eating more enjoyable. While the general guidelines for healthy eating apply to everyone, pregnant women have specific nutritional needs that should be addressed with the help of a healthcare provider."}
{"question": "Pregnant women often wonder, \"How can I ensure I’m eating the right foods for my pregnancy?\" or \"What should my daily diet look like during pregnancy?\"", "answer": "To ensure you meet your nutritional needs during pregnancy, it’s important to eat a variety of foods that provide essential nutrients for both you and your baby. Aim to include lots of colorful vegetables and fruits, whole grains, and protein-rich foods in your meals. Taking a daily multivitamin with folic acid and iron is recommended, as these nutrients play a critical role in fetal development. Eat regularly based on your appetite, typically three meals a day, and include one or two snacks as needed. It’s also important to stay hydrated by drinking mostly water, with milk or fortified soy milk as additional sources of nutrition. Avoid restrictive diets and make sure to take precautions to prevent food-borne infections, as these can be harmful during pregnancy."}
{"question": "Many pregnant women ask, \"How often should I eat during pregnancy?\" or \"What’s the best way to manage my meals and snacks?\"", "answer": "To maintain energy levels and reduce pregnancy discomforts like nausea and heartburn, it’s important to eat regularly. You can opt for three main meals a day with a few snacks in between, or choose five to six smaller meals throughout the day. Experiment with different options to determine what fits best with your daily routine and appetite. Eating regularly not only helps keep your energy steady, but it can also prevent common pregnancy issues like nausea and heartburn by avoiding long gaps between meals."}
{"question": "Pregnant women often ask, \"Why is my appetite changing so much during pregnancy?\" or \"Is it normal to feel hungry one day and not the next?\"", "answer": "It’s completely normal for your appetite to fluctuate during pregnancy, as each pregnancy is unique. Hormonal changes in the early stages may increase your appetite, even though your nutritional needs remain the same. As your pregnancy progresses, physical changes like the growing uterus may press on your stomach, which can slow digestion and reduce appetite. Additionally, common pregnancy discomforts, such as nausea or heartburn, can also affect how much or how little you feel like eating. It’s important to listen to your body and adjust your eating habits as needed."}
{"question": "Pregnant women often express surprise or concern over strong cravings for certain foods. Questions like, \"Why am I craving specific foods?\" or \"Are my cravings normal?\" are common.", "answer": "Cravings during pregnancy are common and can range from unhealthy foods like chocolate or salty snacks to more nutritious options like fruit or dairy. These cravings are often driven by hormonal changes, and while they can be intense, they don’t necessarily reflect a specific nutritional need. To help manage cravings, it’s beneficial to eat regularly and maintain a balanced diet. Eating well overall ensures that your body gets the nutrients it needs, even if you occasionally indulge in your cravings. The key is moderation and ensuring that cravings don’t replace healthy meals."}
{"question": "Pregnant women often experience food aversions, leading them to avoid foods they once enjoyed. This can lead to concerns like, \"Why can’t I eat what I used to?\" or \"How can I make sure I’m still getting enough nutrients if I can’t eat certain foods?\"", "answer": "Food aversions are common, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy, and they can cause you to stop eating certain foods, like meat or poultry. However, you can still maintain a balanced diet by substituting other nutritious options, such as legumes, eggs, or fish for protein. If you find that your aversions or cravings are frequent, troublesome, or make it difficult to eat, don’t hesitate to talk to your prenatal care provider or a nutritionist for advice. These experts can help you find solutions to ensure you're meeting both your and your baby’s nutritional needs."}
{"question": "Pregnant women are encouraged to focus on a balanced diet to ensure proper development of the baby and maintain their own health. The message often comes with guidance such as, \"What should I be eating during pregnancy?\" or \"How can I make sure my baby is getting the nutrients they need?\"", "answer": "A healthy diet during pregnancy includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grain foods, and protein-rich foods.

It’s recommended to include them in every meal and snack. They can be enjoyed fresh, frozen, canned, dried, or in sauces and compotes. These food items can easily be steamed, stir-fried, or roasted, and they can be added to soups, cooked dishes, smoothies, or even desserts, providing a wide range of nutrients and flavors to benefit both you and your baby."}
{"question": "Pregnant women may seek advice on how to incorporate more vegetables and fruits into their diet while considering affordability and health benefits.", "answer": "If you’re not accustomed to eating vegetables and fruits at every meal, start by adding small amounts of your favorites, then explore new varieties and cooking methods. Frozen or canned options can be cost-effective, particularly in winter—opt for those with lower salt and sugar content. While juices might seem convenient, they often lack fiber and can be high in salt and sugar, making whole or minimally processed veggies and fruits a better choice for a healthier pregnancy diet."}
{"question": "Pregnant women may inquire about incorporating whole grain foods into their diet and the variety of options available to maintain a nutritious and energy-rich diet.", "answer": "Whole grain foods are essential during pregnancy as they provide a primary source of energy. These include whole grain bread, pasta, oatmeal, and brown rice, along with less common options like quinoa, millet, wild rice, and spelt.

{"question": "What are the different types of discharge during pregnancy, and how can you identify them? How do you estimate whether you're losing amniotic fluid?", "answer": "During pregnancy, vaginal discharge becomes heavier and runnier, particularly in the final months. It can dampen underwear or soak a panty liner. Urine leakage is more common after physical exertion, coughing, or sneezing, and stops once the bladder is emptied. Amniotic fluid, which is clear and odorless, may leak continuously when the baby moves or the mother changes position. To check for amniotic fluid leakage, wear a sanitary pad, check after 30 minutes, and if the pad is soaked, it indicates that your waters may have broken."}
{"question": "What are the causes of bleeding in early pregnancy, and how is miscarriage related to early pregnancy bleeding?", "answer": "Early pregnancy bleeding is common and may occur due to changes like embryo implantation in the uterus. However, about half of women who experience bleeding early in pregnancy may have a miscarriage. In some cases, miscarriage can happen without any symptoms or bleeding. If you experience bleeding during pregnancy, it's important to seek medical evaluation to determine the cause and ensure proper care."}
{"question": "What are the causes of miscarriage, and how does Rh negative blood impact the situation?", "answer": "Miscarriage is a common occurrence, with about one in six pregnancies ending this way, especially in the first 12 weeks. Most miscarriages are caused by major genetic abnormalities, where the embryo doesn't develop properly, or the baby's heart stops beating. In such cases, the uterus stops growing and expels its contents. If a woman has Rh negative blood, she may need to receive immunoglobulin (WinRho®) following bleeding or miscarriage to prevent complications in future pregnancies. Your healthcare professional will assess whether this is necessary."}
{"question": "How does the risk of miscarriage change with age? What is the miscarriage risk for women over 35 and over 40?", "answer": "The risk of miscarriage increases with age. For women aged 35 and older, one in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage. The risk becomes even higher for women aged 40 and over, with about one in two pregnancies ending in miscarriage."}

{"question": "What emotions are common after a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy? Is it normal to grieve? Are there any misconceptions about what causes a miscarriage?", "answer": "After a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, it is normal to feel sad, distressed, and go through a period of mourning. Emotions such as anger, denial, and confusion are common, and some women may even feel guilty, wrongly believing they caused the loss. However, miscarriage is not caused by stress, fatigue, physical activity, diet, or lifting heavy objects. If you're concerned about future pregnancies, it's helpful to discuss these concerns with your health professional."}
{"question": "How do people grieve after losing an unborn child? Do men and women grieve the same way? How can you get help with grief or inform family and friends? Are there any benefits available for the loss of an unborn child after 19 weeks?", "answer": "The grieving process after losing an unborn child is personal and influenced by individual circumstances. Some may bond emotionally with their child early, while for others, the loss represents the end of their parenting plans. Grief is experienced differently by men and women, and individuals may go through stages of grief at varying times. It's important to give yourself time and space to grieve. If you need help informing others, consider talking to someone who has experienced similar loss or seeking advice from a health professional. Additionally, if your baby dies after 19 weeks or after birth, you may be entitled to benefits under the Québec Parental Insurance Plan."}
{"question": "What is hypertension during pregnancy? How is it managed?

{"question": "What is a multiple pregnancy? What are the types of twins, and how do they differ?", "answer": "A multiple pregnancy involves expecting more than one baby, which can be a surprising and life-changing experience for many families. Prenatal care, birth planning, and family life adjustments are necessary to accommodate the new arrivals. There are two types of twins- identical twins, which come from the same egg and sperm, sharing the same genetic makeup, sex, and often a placenta; and fraternal twins, which come from separate eggs and sperm, having different genetic makeups, their own placentas, and potentially different sexes."}
{"question": "What physical changes do women with multiple pregnancies experience? What are the risks and nutritional needs for multiple pregnancies? Is vaginal birth possible? What support resources are available?", "answer": "Women with multiple pregnancies often experience faster and more intense physical changes, which can result in increased fatigue and discomfort. If these discomforts become bothersome, discussing them with a prenatal care provider is recommended. Multiple pregnancies also come with higher nutritional requirements and an increased risk of complications, including preterm labor, which can lead to premature birth.

It also lowers the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes. For mothers, breastfeeding delays the return of menstrual periods, reducing the risk of anemia, and lowers the likelihood of developing diabetes or certain cancers. If a mother is taking medication, it's important to discuss it with a healthcare provider to ensure compatibility with breastfeeding. Even if the mother is sick, breastfeeding is still recommended, but she should take precautions such as wearing a medical mask and washing her hands before feeding to prevent transmission of germs."}
{"question": "How does breastfeeding develop as a skill, and what should a new mother expect during the early stages? What support is recommended during this learning period?", "answer": "Breastfeeding is a skill that requires practice, and it takes time for both the mother and the baby to get comfortable. Initially, you’ll learn the theory, but putting it into practice may bring unexpected challenges. It can take four to six weeks for some women to feel fully comfortable with breastfeeding, while others may adjust more quickly. During this learning phase, you and your partner will work together as a team to figure out what works best for you both. It’s normal to face moments of difficulty, and seeking support from family, friends, or breastfeeding resources is encouraged. With practice, breastfeeding will eventually become more natural and enjoyable."}
{"question": "What happens in the first few days after birth in terms of milk production? How does colostrum help during this early period?", "answer": "After childbirth, your body begins producing milk, and the first type of milk is called colostrum. Colostrum is thick, yellowish, and packed with the nutrients your newborn needs. Although you might feel like you're not producing much milk, the small amounts of colostrum are perfectly suited to your baby's needs in the first few days. It's normal for your baby to nurse frequently during this time, as she adjusts to feeding outside the womb. This early breastfeeding period is crucial for establishing milk production and bonding with your baby. Your breasts have naturally prepared for this process throughout pregnancy, and they will provide the milk your baby needs."}
{"question": "How does frequent breastfeeding or breast stimulation support milk production?", "answer": "Stimulating the breasts by nursing at least 8 times every 24 hours is essential for establishing a good milk supply. This frequent nursing helps prevent breast engorgement and supports the initial stages of milk production. If your baby isn't ready to nurse, you can still stimulate milk production by expressing milk manually or using a breast pump. Regular breast stimulation is key to ensuring your milk supply is sufficient and to keeping your breasts comfortable during this early period of breastfeeding."}
{"question": "How does milk production change after childbirth?", "answer": "Between the second and fifth day after childbirth, milk production increases rapidly, and the milk becomes clearer in color. This process is referred to as your milk \"coming in\" and is triggered by hormonal changes. This happens for all women, regardless of whether they breastfeed or not. This increase in milk supply ensures that your baby receives the nutrients they need as they adjust to feeding outside the womb. For more information, refer to the section on milk production changes."}
{"question": "How does breast milk change to meet the baby’s needs?", "answer": "Breast milk changes in composition throughout the breastfeeding period to meet the evolving needs of the baby. It contains proteins, sugars, and fats, including omega-3 fatty acids, which support brain and eye development. Additionally, it provides essential vitamins and minerals needed for growth, although vitamin D is not present in sufficient amounts (refer to Vitamin D section). Breast milk also contains enzymes that aid digestion and antibodies that help protect against infections, strengthening the baby’s immune system. Over 200 components have been identified in breast milk, and factors such as the mother’s diet can influence its composition and taste."}
{"question": "How to promote successful breastfeeding right after birth.", "answer": "To make breastfeeding easier, it is beneficial to practice skin-to-skin contact with your newborn during the first hours after birth. This contact helps regulate the baby’s body temperature, calms them, and triggers the breastfeeding reflex, making it easier to initiate breastfeeding. The first feeding during this time can create a memory that helps the baby recall how to nurse in future sessions. If the baby is not ready to nurse immediately, expressing milk manually or using a spoon to offer a few drops can help start milk production and encourage the baby to begin breastfeeding."}
{"question": "How keeping the baby close and recognizing hunger signs enhances breastfeeding.", "answer": "Keeping your baby close to you both day and night helps strengthen the bond between you and your baby. Being physically near your baby allows you to better understand and recognize the early signs of hunger. This proximity makes it easier to offer the breast when needed, as your baby will likely be calmer and more receptive. Responding quickly to these hunger cues also helps build trust and reassures your baby, fostering a stronger emotional connection."}
{"question": "How proper latching technique prevents discomfort and supports breastfeeding success.", "answer": "Getting a good latch is crucial for preventing breastfeeding pain and nipple injuries. In the early days, both you and your baby will learn how to establish a comfortable, effective latch. You’ll know your baby is sucking effectively when you see her pause and swallow, though this motion may be harder to notice before your milk comes in, as she will only be swallowing small amounts of colostrum. Some initial sensitivity is normal, but if nursing is painful, seek help right away to avoid discomfort and ensure successful breastfeeding."}
{"question": "Understanding and responding to the baby's hunger cues and ensuring adequate milk intake.", "answer": "The frequency and duration of breastfeeding can vary between babies, especially in the first few days of life. It’s normal for a newborn to nurse frequently, with clustered feedings. This not only helps stimulate milk production but also reassures the baby during the crucial early days. Expect to nurse at least 8 times every 24 hours, and possibly more. Some babies give clear hunger cues, while others may not. If your baby isn’t showing signs of hunger, you may need to gently wake her to ensure she gets enough milk."}
{"question": "Understanding the differences in feeding methods and the importance of recognizing hunger cues.", "answer": "While expressed milk can be fed through a bottle if necessary, it’s important to recognize that sucking from a bottle is different from breastfeeding. The milk flow is faster from a bottle, and the baby’s mouth movements differ, which can lead to breastfeeding difficulties if used frequently. If a pacifier is used, it may obscure the baby’s hunger cues, potentially leading to missed feedings and affecting milk production. Before offering a pacifier, ensure the baby isn’t hungry or in need of comfort, to support healthy milk production and feeding."}
{"question": "Practical advice for choosing breastfeeding accessories.", "answer": "There are many breastfeeding accessories available, such as breast pumps, nursing bras, pillows, and pads, but none are essential for successful breastfeeding. Nursing pads—either reusable or disposable—can be helpful if your breasts leak milk. While a nursing bra is not a necessity, it can be practical for comfort and convenience. It’s best to purchase one later in pregnancy to ensure it fits your changing breast size. For specific recommendations, community groups and support networks can offer useful advice when selecting accessories like breast pumps."}
{"question": "Reassurance and solutions for common breastfeeding challenges.", "answer": "Despite the many benefits of breastfeeding, some women have concerns, such as fears about being able to breastfeed, not producing enough milk, experiencing sore nipples, or worrying about giving the father the chance to help with feeding. These concerns are often based on myths. While breastfeeding can be challenging in the beginning, most issues, like engorgement, nipple pain, or worries about milk production, are temporary and can be solved. It's important to talk to a trained breastfeeding support person or mentor to address any concerns and prepare for breastfeeding. Remember, most breastfeeding difficulties are short-term and solutions are available."}
{"question": "Encouraging active involvement from partners and family in breastfeeding and infant care.", "answer": "Pregnancy is an ideal time for open discussions about breastfeeding with your partner, family, and friends, and to explore breastfeeding resources and community support. Partners play an essential role in the breastfeeding process by offering emotional and physical support. At the beginning, the partner can assist with tasks like helping the mother get the baby latched, providing comfort and encouragement, and managing practical needs like snacks or drinks. Partners can also shield the mother from negative influences and seek out additional support if needed. By working together as a team, partners can help establish a smooth breastfeeding routine, bond with the baby, and ease into parenting roles, making the experience more manageable for the breastfeeding mother."}
{"question": "Stressing the importance of family and friends' support during the breastfeeding journey.", "answer": "Whether breastfeeding is a familiar practice in your family or you're the first to do so, it’s important to communicate your plans and intentions clearly. Let your family and friends know how they can best support you in your breastfeeding journey. Their understanding and support can make a significant difference. Don’t hesitate to ask for help with practical tasks like preparing meals, running errands, or caring for the baby, as this will allow you to focus more on breastfeeding and adjusting to your new routine."}
{"question": "Emphasizing early planning for birth and visiting facilities.", "answer": "As your due date approaches, it's important to check with your prenatal care provider about when to head to the hospital or birthing center. Many facilities allow you to contact them directly starting at 20 weeks for any questions. In the weeks leading up to your due date, begin preparing your hospital bag and arrange care for your other children, so you're not stressed when labor begins. You should also think about your birthing options, the services offered by the facility, and any specific rules or routines they have. Many hospitals and birthing centers provide virtual tours or allow in-person visits to familiarize you with the birthing room and equipment available. If you're unsure, ask your health professional or prenatal class instructor about visiting opportunities to ensure you're comfortable with your choice of location."}
{"question": "What are the essential items to bring to the hospital or birthing centre for the mother? Do I need health insurance proof, hospital cards, and pregnancy documents? Should I pack comfortable clothes, toiletries, and personal items like snacks and medication?", "answer": "When preparing for your hospital or birthing centre stay, ensure you bring essential documents like your health insurance card, hospital card, pregnancy notebook, and birth plan. Pack comfortable clothes for both labour and post-delivery, along with toiletries, snacks, and any medications you're taking. Don’t forget items for personal comfort during labour such as massage oil, extra pillows, and a hot water bottle. Other helpful items include your vaccination record, nursing bras, a going-home outfit, maxi pads, reading material, and a watch."}
{"question": "What should the partner bring to the hospital or birthing centre? What are the essential items for the baby, such as clothing, diapers, and a car seat?", "answer": "The partner should pack comfortable clothes, shoes, and pyjamas, as well as a pillow, toiletries, and reading material. If they wish to join in the whirlpool during labour, a bathing suit is useful. Don't forget food, drinks, and a camera. For the baby, pack diapers (if not provided by the hospital), pyjamas, undershirts, bodysuits, a blanket, and a hat. Also, prepare a going-home outfit suitable for the season and an infant car seat, which is required for leaving the hospital by car."}
{"question": "Can women who have had a C-section give birth vaginally in the future? What are the benefits and risks of attempting a VBAC?", "answer": "Yes, many women who have had a C-section are able to give birth vaginally in subsequent pregnancies, with around three in four successfully having a vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC). The benefits of VBAC include no risks from surgery, immediate bonding with the baby, greater mobility, and a shorter recovery time. However, VBAC carries a very low risk of uterine rupture, which, though rare, can have serious consequences and may require an emergency C-section. A planned C-section also carries its own risks."}
{"question": "How do you decide whether to have a vaginal birth after a C-section? What factors influence the decision, and can the plan change during pregnancy?", "answer": "The decision to have a VBAC is made with the guidance of your doctor or midwife, who will assess factors that can influence your chances of having a successful vaginal birth. It is important to communicate your preferences and needs during this discussion. In some cases, vaginal birth may not be recommended due to medical contraindications. Your birth plan may evolve during pregnancy, and your healthcare provider may suggest a C-section instead. Similarly, if you initially planned for a C-section, labor may start early, leading to a possible change in plans to deliver vaginally."}
{"question": "How do you prepare for a VBAC, and what types of support can help during labor? Can you use pain relief options during a VBAC?", "answer": "Preparing for a VBAC involves the same steps as preparing for any vaginal birth, such as taking prenatal classes and learning about pain relief options. Having support during labor, whether from a friend, family member, or doula, can improve the experience by making the delivery smoother and reducing the likelihood of needing a C-section. You can also opt for pain relief options like an epidural during labor, if desired."}
{"question": "What happens if your baby is in a breech position, and what are the options for delivery? Can your doctor help turn the baby, and what happens if vaginal birth is not possible?", "answer": "If your baby is in a breech position, your doctor or midwife may attempt to turn the baby into a head-down position around 36 or 37 weeks using a procedure called version, which increases the chances of a vaginal birth. This procedure is performed in the hospital and followed by monitoring to ensure the baby tolerates it. If turning the baby isn't possible, a vaginal breech delivery may be considered, but it requires specific conditions and may not be offered in every hospital. In most cases, a cesarean section will be recommended. Always discuss your options with your healthcare provider."}
{"question": "How should you prepare for the birth, and why is a birth plan helpful? What are some things to consider when making one, and how can you share it with your healthcare providers?", "answer": "Preparing for the birth includes identifying your wishes and concerns, sharing them with your partner, family, and friends, and informing the healthcare professionals who will assist you. A birth plan is a helpful tool that allows you to communicate your preferences, whether written or verbal, to everyone involved in the birth. It ensures your values and preferences are understood. Be sure to find out about the services available at your birthing facility and consider looking for sample birth plans, which can be found online, at prenatal classes, or through your healthcare provider."}
{"question": "What should you think about when preparing your birth plan regarding support, pain management, and the birth environment? How can you plan for specific methods, techniques, and positions?", "answer": "When preparing your birth plan, consider who you want with you during labour and the birth, and whether you'd like a doula to assist. It’s also helpful to know in advance which medical staff will be present. Regarding pain management, think about the methods you'd like to use, the type of environment you'd prefer, and whether you want to use specific techniques or medications for relief. Also, consider the positions you want to try during labour and delivery, as well as the equipment and accessories available at your birthing facility."}
{"question": "What interventions may be considered during childbirth, and how can you plan for them? What should you know about these procedures, and how can you prepare for unexpected situations like a caesarean birth?", "answer": "When preparing your birth plan, consider the possible interventions available at your hospital or birthing centre, such as labour induction, fetal monitoring, epidurals, and episiotomy. Ask about the reasons for these procedures and their potential effects on you and your baby. Decide which procedures you'd like to have during delivery and which ones you prefer to refuse. Also, prepare for unexpected developments, including the possibility of a caesarean birth, and decide whether you'd like someone with you during the procedure."}
{"question": "What are your preferences for the first moments with your baby? How do you envision rooming-in and ensuring privacy at the hospital or birthing centre?", "answer": "When planning for the first moments with your baby, consider whether you'd like immediate skin-to-skin contact after birth and how you want to handle rooming-in. Check if staying with your baby at all times is possible and encouraged at the hospital or birthing centre. If you have someone with you, decide if they'd be able to stay at all times. In a shared room, ask about measures to ensure privacy and rooming-in. Also, inquire about the hospital's routines and procedures to find out if there are times you can request privacy or rest without disturbance."}
{"question": "What exams and interventions will be suggested for you and your baby after birth? How will you handle unexpected developments, like a premature baby? What measures can help you stay with your baby during hospitalization and support breastfeeding?", "answer": "After birth, inquire about any exams, interventions, or medications recommended for you and your baby, and ask about their reasons, timing, and possible consequences. Be prepared for unexpected situations, such as if your baby is premature and needs to stay in the hospital. Ensure you have access to measures that allow you to remain with your baby throughout their hospitalization. If you're planning to breastfeed, find out what support is available at the hospital or birthing centre, including the use of breast milk banks if necessary."}
{"question": "How do you want to feed your baby? Have you discussed your breastfeeding decision with your family and hospital staff? Does your hospital have breastfeeding support? How would you feel about using formula or supplements if needed, especially if your baby is premature?", "answer": "When planning to feed your baby, decide if you want to breastfeed and communicate this decision to both your family and the staff at your hospital or birthing centre. Ensure that your hospital has knowledgeable staff to assist you with breastfeeding if needed. If your baby is premature or if complications arise, be prepared to consider commercial infant formula or supplements, and discuss your feelings about this possibility with your healthcare team."}
{"question": "How can you prepare for your baby’s arrival at home? What can you do to organize your home and make it easier to adjust? What should you do if you need help? How can you manage the first days and weeks with your baby?", "answer": "To prepare for your baby's arrival, you can cook extra meals and freeze them, get the house ready by borrowing or buying baby essentials, and make a list of things you may need help with, like errands or cleaning. If help isn’t offered, don't hesitate to ask for assistance in advance. Being flexible and open to support will help you adjust during your baby's first days and weeks at home."}
{"question": "When does labor typically begin, and what are the signs? How do you know if your mucus plug has been lost, and does it signal the start of labor?", "answer": "Labor usually begins spontaneously between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy, and while the expected delivery date is a guideline, it's not a strict deadline. If labor doesn't begin by 41 weeks, your doctor or midwife may suggest tests to determine if induction is necessary. The mucus plug, which may be lost in stages and sometimes tinged with blood, doesn’t always signal that labor has started. While its loss is one sign, other signs, such as contractions or waters breaking, should follow to indicate the onset of labor."}
{"question": "What are contractions, and how do they signal the start of labor? How do contractions feel, and how do they differ from woman to woman?", "answer": "Contractions mark the start of labor for most women. During contractions, the belly tightens, and pain is experienced, typically lasting at least 20 seconds. The pain can vary, with some women feeling it in the lower abdomen and others in the lower back, sometimes radiating to the front. Some describe contractions as similar to menstrual cramps but more intense. Each woman's experience with contractions is unique, and the sensations can differ from one pregnancy to another. As labor progresses, contractions become more regular and increasingly intense."}
{"question": "What does it mean when your waters break, and how does it signal the start of labor? How much fluid is released, and what should you do when it happens?", "answer": "The breaking of the waters, or rupture of the amniotic membrane, can signal the beginning of labor for some women. The amniotic sac holds fluid around your baby, and when it ruptures, the amniotic fluid leaks out, which may appear clear or slightly tinged with blood. The amount of fluid can vary, ranging from a few drops to enough to wet your clothes or even drip onto the floor. Labor usually starts within hours after the water breaks, but if contractions don’t begin or if you are a carrier of group B streptococcus (GBS), labor might need to be induced. Regardless of whether contractions have started, you should go to the hospital or birthing center, where staff will check on both your baby’s well-being and confirm whether your water has actually broken or if it’s just vaginal discharge."}
{"question": "When should you head to the hospital or birthing center during labor? What are the signs that indicate it's time to go?", "answer": "You should go to the hospital or birthing center immediately if any of the following occurs-if it's your first delivery and you have regular contractions every five minutes or less for an hour, or if you’ve had previous deliveries and experience regular contractions every five minutes or less. If you live more than 30 minutes away, head to the hospital when contractions occur every ten minutes. Also, go if your water breaks, you’re losing blood, or you no longer feel your baby move. Towards the end of your pregnancy, it’s important to consult with your doctor or midwife about when is the right time to go, considering factors like your health, previous deliveries, and how far you live from the hospital."}
{"question": "How can you cope with the pain of labor without medication? What should you understand about the pain of labor?", "answer": "The pain of labor is unique and serves an important purpose—it signals the start of the opening process leading to the birth of your baby. The intensity of pain gradually increases, with stronger pain during contractions, while the periods between contractions provide time for recovery. Some women find the beginning of labor the hardest, while others struggle most when it's time to push. To cope with the pain without medication, it’s helpful to learn and prepare in advance about various non-medical techniques that can assist in managing labor pain effectively. Understanding the rhythm and purpose of pain can also help women and couples feel more empowered during the process."}
{"question": "Why is it important to have someone with you during childbirth, and how can a partner support during labor?", "answer": "Having someone you trust with you during childbirth, such as the baby’s father, your partner, a family member, friend, or doula, provides emotional reassurance, encouragement, and support, helping you feel more comfortable and confident. Partners, while they may feel powerless, play a crucial role by staying present, maintaining a positive and caring attitude, and offering constant encouragement during this intense and emotional experience. Their support can make a significant difference in helping you cope with labor challenges."}
{"question": "Why is creating a supportive environment important during childbirth, and how can it be achieved?", "answer": "Creating a supportive environment during childbirth is vital as it helps women feel calm, safe, and confident, promoting the secretion of hormones essential for labor. This can be achieved by dimming the lights, reducing ambient noise, lowering monitor volumes, and encouraging people to whisper, ensuring a tranquil and reassuring atmosphere."}
{"question": "What techniques can help manage childbirth pain, and how do they work?", "answer": "To manage childbirth pain, you can use techniques such as movement and trying different positions. Moving, walking, squatting, or using a physio ball can help labor progress and provide relief by finding comfortable positions. Experimenting with these options at different stages of labor ensures you discover what works best for you."}
{"question": "How can water be used to manage childbirth pain, and why is it effective?", "answer": "Water can help manage childbirth pain through baths or showers, which are often available in hospitals and birthing centers. Many women find the warmth and buoyancy of water soothing, as it helps reduce pain and promotes relaxation during labor."}
{"question": "How can massage be used to ease childbirth pain, and what methods might be effective?", "answer": "Massage can ease childbirth pain by reducing anxiety and helping women cope with contractions. Gentle massage provides comfort, while vigorous massage or acupressure on painful areas can offer relief during contractions, making the experience more manageable."}
{"question": "How can compresses and relaxation methods help manage pain during childbirth, and what practices are recommended?", "answer": "Compresses, whether hot or cold, can reduce pain by soothing painful areas, while relaxation methods like breathing techniques, visualization, self-hypnosis, or yoga practiced during pregnancy prepare women for childbirth. During labour, listening to music and creating a calm, private environment further enhances relaxation and pain management."}
{"question": "What other techniques are available for managing childbirth pain, and what should you do if non-drug methods no longer work?", "answer": "Additional techniques for managing childbirth pain include sterile water injections under the skin and TENS machines for electrical stimulation of painful areas; you can inquire about these options from your healthcare provider. If non-drug methods are no longer effective, pain relief through medication is a viable alternative to consider."}
{"question": "What are some effective strategies for coping with childbirth pain, and how can others assist you during labour?", "answer": "Effective strategies for coping with childbirth pain include staying warm, trusting your instincts, and visualizing the birthing process. Moving around, changing positions, and using showers or baths can provide relief. Relaxation techniques such as slow breathing, making noise, and eating or drinking as needed can also help. Emotional support is vital; having someone encourage you, massage you, hold your hand, or sponge you with a wet compress can make a significant difference. Don’t hesitate to ask for what would make you feel better."}
{"question": "What positions can help during labour, and how do they support the birthing process?", "answer": "During labour, various positions can aid cervical dilation and promote relaxation. Standing, squatting, sitting on a physio ball, or kneeling on all fours with an upright upper body can help speed up labour. Lying flat on your back is often uncomfortable, but lying on your side can provide more relief if resting is needed. Trying different positions helps adapt to changing needs during labour and can make the process more effective and tolerable."}
{"question": "What are the three main stages of labor? What happens during each stage of childbirth? How long does each stage last?", "answer": "Childbirth is divided into three main stages. The first stage involves the thinning and opening of the cervix, known as dilation. The second stage is the descent and birth of the baby. The third stage is the delivery of the placenta. The length of each stage varies from one delivery to another, making it unpredictable."}
{"question": "What happens during the latent phase of labor? How can you differentiate between early labor and false labor? When should you go to the hospital during the latent phase?", "answer": "The latent phase of labor involves contractions that are usually not very strong and may feel irregular and short. During this phase, it can be hard to determine whether it's the start of labor or false labor. You may still be able to talk during contractions. It’s important to stay calm, rest, eat, and shower if desired. The phase can be long or short, and you don’t need to go to the hospital unless your water breaks or you no longer feel the baby moving. If contractions weaken or stop, it’s considered false labor, which is preparatory labor helping to ripen the cervix."}
{"question": "What happens during active labor? How do contractions change during this phase? What is the second stage of labor like emotionally, and how can you cope with it?", "answer": "During active labor, contractions become more painful, closer together, and longer, signaling that the cervix has thinned and dilated to about 3 to 5 centimeters. The contractions gradually increase in intensity as the cervix opens to 10 cm. The most painful contractions occur just before complete dilation. The second stage, known as descent, can feel intense and emotional, often compared to a storm. You may experience strong emotions, feel the urge to make noise, or lose control, which is normal. To cope, focus on breathing, visualize your baby moving down, and stay connected to the process."}
{"question": "What happens when your cervix is fully dilated? How does the urge to push feel, and what should you do if you feel it before complete dilation? Is it normal to have a bowel movement or experience a perineal tear during pushing? How does an epidural affect the sensation of the urge to push?", "answer": "Once your cervix is fully dilated to 10 cm, the sensations change, and you’ll likely feel the urge to push. The contractions become forceful, focusing all your energy on pushing your baby out. If you feel the urge before full dilation, your care team will guide you on when to begin pushing to make it more effective. During pushing, a bowel movement is normal, and your perineum may tear if it doesn’t stretch enough, but these tears typically heal well. If you have an epidural, the urge to push may be diminished initially, but you will regain awareness as your baby descends, allowing you to push more effectively."}

{"question": "What happens after the birth of the baby during the third stage of labor? How does the body respond to prevent hemorrhaging, and what role does breastfeeding play? What are the treatments if contractions are not strong enough?", "answer": "After your baby is born, the delivery isn't over as the placenta still needs to be delivered. Contractions will continue for a little while to expel the placenta. Once delivered, your uterus will keep contracting to prevent hemorrhages and return to its original shape. Breastfeeding stimulates oxytocin production, which helps increase uterine contractions. If contractions aren't strong enough, massaging the abdomen or administering oxytocin medication may be necessary to encourage proper contractions and prevent hemorrhaging."}
{"question": "What happens in the first moments after the baby is born? How does skin-to-skin contact benefit both the baby and mother? What role does breastfeeding play during this time?", "answer": "Immediately after birth, your baby will make his first sounds and be placed on your chest. The care team will ensure he is healthy, drying him off and clearing any secretions from his nose and mouth if needed. Skin-to-skin contact is encouraged, ideally for at least two hours, which helps your baby regulate body heat, breathing, and heartbeat while fostering a sense of safety. This bonding time also facilitates breastfeeding, as your baby will instinctively seek comfort and nourishment from nursing, with assistance from the care team as needed to get started."}
{"question": "What should you do if immediate skin-to-skin contact isn't possible? How does skin-to-skin contact or being held by a parent or significant person benefit the baby? What are the emotional aspects of this bonding time?", "answer": "If immediate skin-to-skin contact isn't possible due to medical conditions, the father or another significant person can hold the baby. Don’t worry if skin-to-skin contact isn’t made right away—there will be other opportunities, and your baby will be just fine. Whether it's with you or another loved one, your baby will feel comforted by the warmth of the body and will begin to recognize familiar voices. During this bonding time, your baby will exhibit movements such as sticking out his tongue, blinking, and breathing more quickly. This marks a wonderful and emotional period of discovery for the family, strengthening the connection."}
{"question": "What is a membrane sweep and why might a healthcare provider suggest it? How is the procedure performed, and what should you expect afterwards?", "answer": "A membrane sweep, or stripping the membranes, is a procedure that may be suggested toward the end of pregnancy to help trigger uterine contractions and avoid artificial induction if you reach 41 weeks. It is done during a vaginal exam to assess the cervix’s dilation and consistency. The procedure can be uncomfortable or even painful, and some women may experience spotting for up to 24 hours afterward."}
{"question": "Why is labour induced, and when might it be necessary? What situations might lead to induction, and what should you discuss with your healthcare provider?", "answer": "Labour is induced for medical reasons, such as when the water has broken but contractions have not started, or if the pregnancy has surpassed 41 weeks. In rare cases, the health of the mother or baby may also require induction. It is important to discuss the reasons for induction and its potential risks with your healthcare provider."}
{"question": "What are the different methods used to induce labour, and how do they work? How is the cervix prepared, and what methods might be used to start contractions or break the water?", "answer": "Labour can be induced through various methods, depending on factors such as cervix ripeness and whether it's a first delivery. To prepare the cervix, hormonal treatments may be used, either vaginally or orally, to soften and thin it. A catheter with a small balloon can also be inserted into the cervix to help open it. Contractions may be induced with medication given intravenously, orally, or vaginally. In some cases, the water may be artificially ruptured, which is a relatively painless procedure that does not harm the baby."}
{"question": "When might labour be stimulated, and what method is used? How does oxytocin help in this process?", "answer": "Labour may be stimulated if the cervix is not dilating and contractions are either too weak or too far apart. Oxytocin, a hormone, is intravenously administered to increase the frequency and strength of contractions. Once it takes effect, oxytocin is usually given continuously until the baby is born."}
{"question": "Why might a fetal monitor be used, and how does it work? What should you do if the monitor is uncomfortable or the heartbeat is not heard?", "answer": "A fetal monitor is used if the baby needs to be watched more closely, with monitoring either intermittent or continuous. Two sensors are strapped to the abdomen—one tracks the baby's heartbeat, and the other records contractions and movements. If the monitor is uncomfortable, you can ask for monitoring breaks to move around. If the heartbeat isn't heard, it's usually due to sensor movement, and staff can adjust it."}
{"question": "When is fetal monitoring used, and why is it necessary?", "answer": "Fetal monitoring is used during the last trimester, particularly if there are health concerns such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or issues with the baby, like reduced movement, being underweight, or having insufficient amniotic fluid. It helps ensure the baby is doing well in these situations."}
{"question": "Why is monitoring used when inducing or stimulating labour with drugs, and how long does it continue?", "answer": "Monitoring is used when inducing or stimulating labour with drugs to ensure the baby's well-being and to assess the frequency of contractions. This monitoring continues until the baby is born."}
{"question": "Why is monitoring used during labour, and in what situations is it necessary?", "answer": "Monitoring during labour is used to ensure the baby is doing well, to track the frequency of contractions, and to observe how the baby is handling them. It is necessary if there are concerns about the baby's well-being, if you request an epidural, are planning a VBAC, or have a high-risk pregnancy. In a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy, the baby’s heart will be checked regularly with an ultrasound machine."}
{"question": "Different pain medication options during childbirth", "answer": "In hospitals, pain medication options during labor may include an epidural, narcotics, nitrous oxide gas, or a pudendal nerve block. It's important to ask in advance which options are available at your hospital, as everyone's reaction to medication can vary. Don't hesitate to ask your prenatal care provider or delivery team if you have any questions about these options."}
{"question": "How epidural anaesthesia works and its effects", "answer": "Epidural anaesthesia is a highly effective pain relief method during childbirth. It involves injecting a local anaesthetic through a catheter inserted between two vertebrae in the lower back. This numbs the abdominal area and partially numbs the legs. While it effectively reduces or eliminates labor pain, it may also diminish contractions and restrict movement, which could slow down the baby's descent. Before administering an epidural, a thorough evaluation will be conducted to ensure that it is suitable for you."}
{"question": "Preparation for epidural and associated changes during labor", "answer": "Before receiving an epidural, you will be connected to an intravenous (IV) line, which will remain in place until the medication wears off. A continuous fetal monitor is usually applied, especially if medications are used to stimulate contractions. Depending on the hospital's protocols, you may still be able to walk around and use the bathroom while under the epidural, but if urination becomes difficult, a urinary catheter may be required. The epidural’s effects can make it more challenging to feel when to push, potentially increasing the need for instruments like vacuum extractors or forceps to assist with delivery. However, epidurals do not increase the risk of a caesarean delivery."}
{"question": "Administration, effects, and side effects of narcotics", "answer": "Narcotics are analgesics that can be administered via injection into a muscle or vein to relieve pain during the early stages of labor. They reduce pain but do not eliminate it completely. As labor progresses and pain increases, higher doses may be needed. However, the side effects of narcotics—such as sleepiness, nausea, and changes in heart rate—also intensify with the dose. These medications can affect the baby as well, which is why they are generally not used during the later stages of labor. After birth, the baby may require monitoring for a few hours to ensure the drugs are cleared from their system. Despite these temporary effects, narcotics do not have any long-term consequences for either the mother or the baby."}
{"question": "Administration and effects of nitrous oxide", "answer": "Nitrous oxide, commonly known as \"laughing gas,\" is administered through a breathing mask to provide partial pain relief during labor. It is generally well tolerated but can cause side effects like nausea and dizziness in some individuals."}
{"question": "Administration and effects of pudendal nerve block", "answer": "A pudendal nerve block is a pain relief method given just before the pushing stage of labor. It works by reducing pain in the perineum and vaginal area. The procedure involves injecting an anesthetic into the two pudendal nerves through the vagina using a long needle."}
{"question": "Use and risks of episiotomy", "answer": "An episiotomy is an incision made in the perineum just before delivery to help the baby exit more quickly. It is done under local anesthesia, and the incision is sutured after the birth. However, episiotomies are no longer routinely performed because they can increase the risk of deeper perineal tears."}
{"question": "Surgical procedure for delivery", "answer": "A caesarean section (C-section) is a surgical procedure used when a baby cannot be delivered vaginally. It involves making an incision in the mother’s abdomen and uterus to remove the baby. In Québec, about one in four women deliver via C-section."}
{"question": "What are the reasons for planning a caesarean? When might an unplanned caesarean be necessary? What are the medical situations that call for a planned caesarean? What could trigger an unplanned caesarean?", "answer": "A caesarean can be planned for medical issues with the mother, placenta prævia, breech presentation, or a previous caesarean with conditions that are not favorable for vaginal delivery. Unplanned caesareans may be required when the baby is in an unsafe position, when there are concerns about the baby’s health, if labour does not progress, or when the mother has serious medical problems."}
{"question": "What happens before a caesarean? What types of anaesthesia are used during a caesarean? Who can be present during the operation? How is skin-to-skin contact initiated after a caesarean? What happens during the surgical procedure, and how is the baby delivered?", "answer": "Before a caesarean, the mother receives an intravenous solution (IV) and has a urinary catheter fitted. Anaesthesia typically involves an epidural or spinal block, although a general anaesthetic may be used in rare cases. The person accompanying the mother can enter the operating room and sit near her. After the delivery, skin-to-skin contact with the baby can begin in the operating or recovery room, depending on the circumstances. The placenta is removed, and the incision, typically horizontal and above the pubic hairline, is closed with stitches or staples. The baby is placed against the mother’s skin if both are stable."}
{"question": "What are the short-term effects of a caesarean? What complications can arise from a caesarean delivery? What are the long-term effects on the mother? How might a caesarean affect the baby?", "answer": "Short-term effects of a caesarean include abdominal and pelvic pain requiring medication, difficulty urinating, potential breastfeeding difficulties, a longer hospital stay, and a longer recovery compared to vaginal birth. Complications can arise, such as infection, bleeding, thrombophlebitis, and injury to internal organs, which may require further interventions. Long-term, a caesarean can increase the risk of placental disorders in future pregnancies and the rare risk of uterine rupture during a vaginal birth. For babies, caesarean delivery may result in lower body temperature and mild respiratory distress, but skin-to-skin contact can help address these issues."}
{"question": "How should a mother recover after a caesarean? What should be done for pain relief and incision care? When can a mother resume activities after a caesarean?", "answer": "After a caesarean, it is important to gradually start walking, drinking, and eating to aid recovery. Moving around helps prevent complications. Pain from the incision and numbness in the surrounding area may occur, with pain relief prescribed by the doctor. The incision will heal over the following weeks, and health professionals will provide guidance on caring for the wound. Mothers are also given advice on newborn care, though babies born by caesarean generally require no special care. It will take a few weeks to resume activities such as driving, lifting, certain physical activities, or having sexual relations."}
{"question": "How does skin-to-skin contact benefit a newborn? What is the best way to perform skin-to-skin contact? How does skin-to-skin contact help with breastfeeding?", "answer": "Skin-to-skin contact with your newborn in the early hours, days, and weeks helps soothe and comfort the baby while promoting emotional bonding. To practice it, simply place your baby on your chest with just a diaper on and cover her with a blanket. This type of contact not only strengthens the bond between mother and baby but also makes breastfeeding easier."}
{"question": "How long is the typical stay at a hospital or birthing centre? What are some important tasks and considerations during your stay? Why is rooming-in encouraged, and what should you do before leaving the hospital?", "answer": "After childbirth, your hospital stay typically lasts 24 to 36 hours after a vaginal delivery or 36 to 48 hours after a caesarean section, while stays at birthing centres are usually about 24 hours. During this time, it's a great opportunity to bond with your baby and learn about caring for her. Hospitals often encourage rooming-in, which allows you to feed your baby on demand and begin breastfeeding, with a nurse nearby for assistance. Before leaving, ensure your baby has a car seat, as it's mandatory for travel. If you have any questions about vaccinations, you can meet with a vaccination counselor. Additionally, you'll need to complete any necessary paperwork for the birth."}
{"question": "What care will the nurses and doctors provide to your newborn during your hospital stay? What preventive measures might be suggested for your baby?", "answer": "During your hospital or birthing centre stay, the nurses, doctors, or midwives will provide essential care to ensure your newborn's well-being, including preventive measures like administering a vitamin K shot to prevent bleeding and applying antibiotic ointment to your baby's eyes to prevent serious infections. If you have any concerns or questions about your baby's care, don't hesitate to speak with the health professionals."}
{"question": "What physical examination will your newborn receive during the hospital or birthing centre stay? What is the purpose of this examination?", "answer": "During your stay at the hospital or birthing centre, a health professional will perform a thorough physical examination of your newborn to ensure she is healthy and to identify any potential issues."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of neonatal screening, and what types of screenings are done? How are blood and urine screenings performed for newborns?", "answer": "Neonatal screening aims to detect rare diseases that are not apparent at birth but can pose serious health risks. Early detection allows for treatment before symptoms appear, preventing severe complications. Blood screening is done within a few days of birth by taking a few drops of blood from the baby's heel. Urine screening is performed when the baby is 21 days old, and parents are given a kit and instructions to collect a small quantity of urine during their hospital or birthing centre stay."}
{"question": "What should parents do when things don’t go as planned during childbirth? How should they handle a baby with health problems or a premature baby?", "answer": "When things don’t go as planned during childbirth, parents may have to face unexpected challenges such as health problems, birth defects, or premature birth. In these cases, the baby may require hospitalization for special care. Parents need to adjust to this new reality and the role they may not have anticipated. Babies born prematurely (before 37 weeks) require special care, and the parents should be prepared to support their baby through any necessary medical treatments or interventions."}
{"question": "What care does a premature baby receive if born before 34 weeks? How is a premature baby supported in a neonatal intensive care unit?", "answer": "A premature baby born before 34 weeks is typically transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where they may receive several forms of care. This includes being placed in an incubator to maintain body temperature, receiving phototherapy if jaundiced, and being given an intravenous solution (IV) for hydration and nutrition. Additionally, the baby may require assistance with breathing and feeding until they are strong enough to manage these independently."}
{"question": "What care is given to a baby born between 34 and 37 weeks? What specific treatments may be needed for a late preterm baby?", "answer": "A baby born between 34 and 37 weeks may require extra care, although less intensive than that for babies born earlier. They may receive help with feeding, phototherapy for jaundice, and in rare cases, assistance with breathing if needed."}
{"question": "How can parents cope when their baby is hospitalized? What steps can they take to manage feelings of guilt and get the support they need?", "answer": "When a baby is hospitalized, parents may feel guilty or helpless, but there are ways to cope. Asking questions about the baby's health and treatment is crucial, and parents should feel empowered to explore other options if needed. It’s important to ask the care team about the best times for communication. Additionally, parents can ask for help from family and loved ones for household tasks and caring for other children. Getting enough rest and seeking psychological support, such as from social workers or psychologists, can help parents stay healthy and manage the emotional strain."}
{"question": "What suggestions can help make a hospital stay easier for parents of a hospitalized baby? How can parents stay connected with their baby during this time?", "answer": "Many parents prefer to stay with their baby during hospitalization, either by taking turns with their partner or spending the night together. It’s important to ask the hospital if they offer rooming-in options, although space may be limited. Even if the baby is in an incubator, parents can still encourage breastfeeding and milk production by stimulating their breasts early on. Parents should ask for help with holding their baby or engaging in skin-to-skin contact if possible. If holding the baby is not an option, placing something with the parent's scent near the baby, such as a scarf or piece of clothing, can provide comfort."}
{"question": "How can parents express milk for their baby if breastfeeding isn't immediately possible?", "answer": "If your baby is unable to breastfeed initially, you can express your milk using a breast pump. Hospitals, especially in intensive care wards, usually have breast pumps available and can assist you with expressing milk. Don’t worry if only a few drops come out at first—regular stimulation is key to increasing milk production. Remember, newborns have very small stomachs and only need a small amount of milk at the start. Being close to your baby or having skin-to-skin contact before expressing milk can help increase production. If breastfeeding wasn’t part of your initial plan, it’s not too late to try and begin. Additionally, extra minerals or calories can be added to your milk if necessary for your baby's needs."}
{"question": "How can parents manage hospital visits and support siblings during a newborn's hospitalization?", "answer": "If your baby is in the hospital, you may be able to have visitors, including your other children or loved ones. However, make sure that visitors are healthy and do not have any infections, such as a cold or cold sore, as these can be serious for a newborn. It's also important to address any concerns your other children may have. They might feel worried or guilty about the baby's health, and it can be helpful to reassure them that the situation is not their fault. Slightly older siblings may also feel jealous, thinking their feelings caused the complications. To support them, try to involve them in caring for the baby when possible, as this can help them feel included and reduce negative emotions."}
{"question": "How can parents cope with the loss of a newborn child?", "answer": "The loss of a newborn is an incredibly painful experience, and it’s important to acknowledge the deep emotional and physical challenges parents may face. While it is rare for a baby to die before birth or in the first few days of life, the causes are typically related to extreme prematurity or birth defects. In the event of a stillbirth, medical professionals often recommend a natural or induced vaginal delivery. This can be especially difficult for the mother, as her body may begin producing milk or experience bleeding after delivery, which can serve as painful reminders of the loss. Parents should allow themselves time to grieve and seek support from counselors, support groups, or loved ones to process this profound loss."}
{"question": "How can parents cope with grief after the loss of a baby?", "answer": "Grieving the loss of a baby is an intensely personal and emotional journey. At the hospital, some parents may find comfort in holding their baby, dressing her, or taking photos, as these actions can help in processing the loss. An autopsy may be performed to understand the cause of death, and families are usually offered various funeral options, such as cremation or burial."}
{"question": "After childbirth, how long does it take to recover and what symptoms should be watched for? What signs indicate a need for immediate medical attention or consultation with a healthcare provider?", "answer": "After childbirth, it’s normal for your body to take time to recover, often taking several weeks to regain energy. If you experience signs like heavy bleeding, fever, severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, leg pain with swelling, severe headaches, or changes in vision, it’s important to seek immediate medical attention. Contact your doctor, midwife, or emergency services if you notice symptoms like hemorrhaging or signs of shock such as weakness, confusion, or paleness."}
{"question": "What causes uterine contractions after childbirth, and how do they vary in different pregnancies? What should you do if the pain becomes difficult to manage?", "answer": "After childbirth, uterine contractions can occur, especially while breastfeeding. These contractions may be more intense if it is not your first pregnancy. If the pain becomes uncomfortable or difficult to manage, it’s important to contact your health professional for advice or relief."}
{"question": "What is lochia, and how does the blood loss change after childbirth? When should you consult a healthcare provider? What should you use for managing the discharge?", "answer": "Lochia refers to the blood loss after childbirth, which can be heavier than menstruation during the first couple of days and then gradually decreases. If the bleeding increases rather than decreases, it's important to consult your healthcare provider. Passing blood clots is common, especially in the morning or after breastfeeding, and as long as the bleeding lessens afterward, there's no cause for concern. The color of the discharge changes over time from pink to brown, and eventually yellow. Lochia typically lasts between three to six weeks, and during this period, it's recommended to use sanitary pads instead of tampons or a menstrual cup."}
{"question": "What hygiene practices are important after giving birth? How should you care for yourself after vaginal and caesarean births?", "answer": "After giving birth, maintaining proper hygiene is crucial. It's recommended to change your sanitary pad at least every 4 hours, wipe from front to back, and wash your hands after using the toilet. You should wash yourself once a day or more but avoid using a vaginal douche. If you had a vaginal birth, you can shower or bathe in a clean tub, but avoid oils or bubble baths. If you had a caesarean delivery, you can shower right away, but it's advised to wait about five days before taking a bath, ensuring the incision is healing well."}
{"question": "How should you care for stitches after childbirth? What should you do if you notice signs of infection in your stitches?", "answer": "After childbirth, caring for stitches is essential for healing. If you have stitches in your perineum, don't worry; they won't tear during bowel movements. After showering or bathing, gently dry the stitches before dressing. For those who had a caesarean delivery, it's important to dry the stitches on your belly thoroughly with a clean towel. After seven days, you can remove any adhesive strips that have not naturally come off. If you notice signs of infection, such as redness or discharge, contact your healthcare provider."}
{"question": "What is the normal time for a bowel movement after delivery? What can you do if you experience constipation postpartum?", "answer": "It’s normal not to have a bowel movement for the first two to three days after vaginal delivery or three to five days after a caesarean. If you haven’t had one after this period, you may be constipated, which is common post-delivery. To help with constipation, gradually increase your intake of high-fiber foods, such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts. Drink plenty of water, go to the bathroom as soon as you feel the urge, and start low-intensity physical activity when you're ready. If these steps aren’t enough, consult a healthcare provider to see if a laxative might help."}
{"question": "Is it normal to have trouble with urination after childbirth? How long does it take for the pelvic floor muscles to recover, and what can you do to help?", "answer": "It is normal to experience urine leakage and a burning sensation while urinating in the days following childbirth. You can relieve the burning by spraying your vulva with warm water while urinating. If urine leakage continues for several weeks, mention it to your healthcare provider. The pelvic floor muscles, which support the bladder, uterus, and rectum, may be stretched during pregnancy and childbirth, and it can take several weeks or months for them to regain their tone. Doing Kegel exercises can help, but it's best to consult with your healthcare provider about the right time to start and how to do them properly. If you experience urine leakage, pain during sex, or other issues, talk to your provider for advice or a referral to perineal rehabilitation specialists."}
{"question": "Is it normal to feel fatigued after giving birth? How can you manage your energy levels during recovery?", "answer": "Yes, feeling tired after childbirth is normal, whether you've had a vaginal or caesarean delivery. Recovery takes time, and it can take several weeks to regain a good level of energy. Your recovery speed and energy levels may vary depending on factors like the baby’s demands, your sleep quality, and available support. To manage fatigue, try to rest when your baby sleeps and don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it. Be patient with yourself as your body recovers."}
{"question": "Is it safe to resume physical activity after childbirth? What activities can you start with, and when?", "answer": "Yes, it is safe to gradually resume physical activity after childbirth once you feel ready and your pain has subsided. Begin with low-intensity activities, such as walking, starting with one daily walk and gradually increasing the frequency and length. Around four to six weeks postpartum, you can increase the intensity of your activities, like brisk walking, while listening to your body’s limits. Avoid high-impact exercises like running until your perineum has regained its muscle tone, which can take several weeks to months. Consult with your healthcare provider before resuming activities like swimming or if you had any complications during delivery."}
{"question": "How does weight loss work after pregnancy? What is a reasonable expectation for postpartum weight loss? Should you go on a diet?", "answer": "After childbirth, some weight is lost immediately through the delivery of the baby, placenta, and amniotic fluid, followed by the uterus shrinking and decreased blood volume and swelling. Over the next several weeks, your body will gradually use up the fat reserves accumulated during pregnancy. While weight loss varies from woman to woman, a reasonable expectation is to lose 1 to 2 kg (2 to 4 lb.) per month with a balanced diet and an active lifestyle. Going on a weight-loss diet, especially while breastfeeding, is not recommended as it can affect milk production and your energy levels. It’s important to be patient, as your body may not return to its exact pre-pregnancy shape"}
{"question": "What are baby blues, and how long do they last? What can new mothers do to cope with mood swings? When should you seek help?", "answer": "The baby blues are a common experience after childbirth, marked by mood swings and crying more than usual, typically lasting from a few days to about two weeks. Hormonal changes and fatigue are the main causes of this temporary condition. To cope, it helps to talk about your feelings, allow yourself to cry, get support from family and friends, take naps, care for yourself, and practice skin-to-skin contact with your baby. If the baby blues persist for more than two weeks, or if you feel increasingly sad or irritable, it could indicate postpartum depression, and it’s advisable to contact a healthcare professional such as a psychologist or call Info-Santé at 8-1-1."}
{"question": "What are the signs of depression after childbirth? How can you differentiate between postpartum depression and normal post-birth struggles?", "answer": "Up to 1 in 5 women experience depression after childbirth. The signs of postpartum depression may include sadness, loss of interest in daily activities, changes in appetite, fatigue, anxiety, irritability, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty bonding with the baby, trouble concentrating, and even suicidal thoughts. While some of these signs may overlap with normal post-birth challenges like fatigue or changes in appetite from breastfeeding, it’s important to take them seriously. If you're experiencing several of these symptoms, particularly thoughts of death or difficulty bonding with your baby, it’s important to seek help from a healthcare provider or contact support services."}
{"question": "What are the signs of postpartum depression in men? How can men express depression differently from women?", "answer": "Up to 1 in 10 men experience depression after the birth of a child. While men may feel similar emotions to women, they might express their distress in different ways. Signs of depression in men can include aggression, irritability, mood swings, and physical discomfort such as stomach aches, headaches, or difficulty breathing. Some men may also engage in hyperactive behaviors, like excessive work or sports, or use alcohol or drugs as a coping mechanism. If you or your partner are showing signs of depression, it’s important to seek support. Treatments are available, and consulting a healthcare professional is a vital step in managing mental health."}
{"question": "How can childbirth affect sexual activity and intimacy?", "answer": "After childbirth, many people experience a decrease in sexual desire due to factors such as fatigue, hormonal changes, the adjustment to parenthood, and the physical or emotional recovery from childbirth. Additionally, breastfeeding can cause vaginal dryness due to hormonal changes, which can be alleviated by using a water-based lubricant if needed. The timing of when to resume sexual activity varies for each couple. There are no set rules, and it’s important to listen to your body and your partner’s needs. Intimacy can take on a new form, and there’s no need to rush; adapt to your new life and communicate openly with your partner."}
{"question": "What conditions must be met for breastfeeding to work as a birth control method? Can you rely on it if you haven't had your period yet? When should you consult a healthcare provider?", "answer": "For breastfeeding to work as a birth control method, the following conditions must be met- your baby must be less than six months old, you should breastfeed exclusively without introducing formula, food, or water, and feedings must be on-demand with no more than four hours between feeds during the day and six hours at night. Additionally, you must not have started menstruating yet. Even if you haven't had your period, ovulation may still occur, and you could become pregnant. It is recommended to consult a healthcare provider before using LAM or other natural methods of birth control for guidance."}
{"question": "What factors should you consider when choosing a birth control method? Which methods are the most effective? What precautions should you take when switching birth control methods?", "answer": "When choosing a birth control method, it's important to consider your personal preferences and situation, which should be assessed with a healthcare professional, either at the end of pregnancy or before leaving the hospital. The most effective birth control methods include contraceptive implants, IUDs, contraceptive injections, the progestin-only pill, and combined hormonal contraceptives. When switching methods, do not stop your current birth control method before starting another, and keep condoms handy to avoid unprotected sex. Methods like the withdrawal method and the calendar method are not effective forms of birth control."}
{"question": "When can you start using contraceptive implants after childbirth if there are no contraindications?", "answer": "You can start using contraceptive implants at any time after giving birth, depending on your state of health, as long as there are no contraindications."}
{"question": "When can you start using a hormonal IUD after childbirth if there are no contraindications?", "answer": "You can start using a hormonal IUD at any time after giving birth, depending on your state of health, as long as there are no contraindications."}
{"question": "When is it possible to start using a copper IUD after childbirth, provided there are no contraindications?", "answer": "You can start using a copper IUD at any time after giving birth, depending on your state of health, as long as there are no contraindications."}
{"question": "When can you start using a contraceptive injection after childbirth, and what factors should be considered?", "answer": "You can start using a contraceptive injection depending on your doctor's advice and your state of health after childbirth."}
{"question": "When can you start using the progestin-only pill after childbirth, and are there any restrictions?", "answer": "You can start using the progestin-only pill any time after giving birth, as there are no specific restrictions, assuming no contraindications."}
{"question": "When can you start combined hormonal contraceptives like pills, patches, or vaginal rings after giving birth, and are there any variations in timing?", "answer": "You can start combined hormonal contraceptives (pills, patch, or vaginal ring) six weeks after giving birth. However, depending on your individual situation, your healthcare provider may recommend starting them three to four weeks after giving birth."}
{"question": "When can you start using a diaphragm or cervical cap after giving birth?", "answer": "You can start using a diaphragm or cervical cap six weeks after giving birth."}
{"question": "When can you start using a condom after giving birth?", "answer": "You can start using a condom from the start of sexual relations after giving birth."}
{"question": "How do hormonal contraceptives affect milk production, and what should you do if there’s a problem?", "answer": "Hormonal contraceptives typically do not affect milk quality or baby health. However, combined hormonal contraceptives may cause a slight drop in milk production. If this occurs, consult a lactation consultant, midwife, doctor, or CLSC nurse. Hormonal IUDs, contraceptive injections, and progestin-only pills are unlikely to affect breastfeeding, but if problems arise, seek advice from a healthcare professional."}
{"question": "What are the emergency contraception options after unprotected sex, and how does breastfeeding affect them?", "answer": "Emergency oral contraception (EOC), also known as the morning after pill, is effective up to five days after unprotected or poorly protected sex. It can be used at any time after vaginal delivery or caesarean, regardless of breastfeeding. The sooner it’s taken, the more effective it is. If you are breastfeeding, inform the pharmacist or doctor, who can prescribe an EOC that is safe during breastfeeding."}
{"question": "When can a copper IUD be inserted after unprotected sex, and are there any restrictions?", "answer": "A copper IUD can be inserted up to 7 days after unprotected or poorly protected sex, provided there are no contraindications for you. It is important to consult with your doctor to confirm its suitability."}
{"question": "What is the fetal position, and why does a baby assume it after birth?", "answer": "The fetal position refers to the curled posture that a baby often assumes during the first few weeks of life, similar to the position they had in the womb. This is a natural and instinctive posture for newborns."}
{"question": "What is the average size and weight of a full-term baby, and why does a baby lose weight after birth?", "answer": "A full-term baby, born between 37 and 42 weeks, typically measures 45 to 55 cm (18 to 21 inches) and weighs between 2,500 to 4,300 grams (5.5 to 9.5 lbs.). It is normal for a baby to lose up to 10% of their birth weight in the first few days due to the elimination of meconium, loss of water from being in the womb, and consuming only small amounts of milk. By 10 to 14 days after birth, a healthy full-term baby usually regains their birth weight."}
{"question": "What are the characteristics of a newborn’s skin, including its color and sensitivity, and what changes occur after birth?", "answer": "A newborn's skin can vary in color, with hands and feet often appearing paler or bluish for up to 48 hours due to temperature regulation. The skin may also appear mottled, which typically resolves once the baby is warm. The skin is soft, smooth, and may be translucent in places, with wrinkling and peeling, especially on the hands and feet. At birth, babies may be covered in vernix caseosa, a white protective coating that will absorb within a few hours or days. Some babies, including preterm ones, may also have fine down-like hair that disappears after a few weeks."}
{"question": "What are the characteristics of a newborn’s eyes, including their color and tear production, and when do they change?", "answer": "Newborns with lighter skin typically have blue-grey or slate blue eyes, while darker-skinned babies tend to have dark eyes at birth. The eyes generally reach their permanent color around 3 months, though they may continue to change up to a year. Newborns usually cry without producing tears, which typically appear between 1 and 2 months of age."}
{"question": "How should you care for your newborn’s head, and what changes occur in the skull and fontanels after birth?", "answer": "A newborn's neck is delicate but should allow easy movement; if stiffness occurs, seek advice. Pressure during delivery may temporarily deform the baby's head, but it will return to a rounded shape in a few weeks. The skull bones are not fully connected and are separated by fontanels—soft spots on the head. The anterior fontanel, located on the top of the head, is supple and may visibly beat with the heartbeat. Another smaller triangular fontanel is at the back. These fontanels are fragile but safe to touch and wash. The skull will knit together between 9 and 18 months, and the fontanels will disappear."}
{"question": "Why do newborns sometimes have swollen breasts, and how should you handle this?", "answer": "Both boy and girl babies may experience swollen breasts, which could even produce a small amount of milk. This condition is temporary and typically resolves on its own within a few days. It is important not to attempt to release the milk, as the issue will clear up naturally."}
{"question": "What should parents know about their newborn's genital development and care, and how should they handle potential issues?", "answer": "In newborn girls, the labia minora may be swollen for the first few days after birth, with a whitish deposit present between the lips of the vulva, which should not be cleaned off as it serves as protection. A small amount of blood from the vagina may also occur due to maternal hormones, which is normal. In boys, the testicles are usually descended into the scrotum, but if not, medical advice should be sought. The foreskin should not be forcibly moved, as it will naturally dilate and descend by around age 3 in most boys. Circumcision is not recommended unless for cultural or religious reasons, as it serves no medical purpose."}
{"question": "What types of skin spots are common in newborns, and how should parents react to them?", "answer": "Newborns may have small red spots between their eyes, on the eyelids, or along the back of the scalp, which turn white when lightly pressed and become more visible when the baby cries. These spots typically disappear within the first year. Additionally, some babies may have bluish spots on their buttocks or back, which usually fade by age 3. Other marks may be permanent, but there’s no need for concern with these temporary spots."}
{"question": "Why do newborns sneeze, and should parents be concerned?", "answer": "It's normal for newborns to sneeze frequently, often up to 12 times a day. This is because the hair inside their nose hasn't fully developed, and sneezing helps them clear secretions that may interfere with their breathing. Sneezing is not a sign that your baby has a cold."}
{"question": "Why do babies get hiccups, and is it a cause for concern?", "answer": "It's common for babies to get hiccups, especially after feeding. This is not a serious issue and won’t hurt your baby. The hiccups usually stop on their own within a few minutes. If they persist, putting your baby back on the breast may help stop them."}
{"question": "How can you ensure your newborn is warm without overheating, and what is the ideal room temperature?", "answer": "Newborns need warmth, but it's important not to overdo it. They should not perspire, and if the room temperature is comfortable for you, it will likely be comfortable for your baby too. The ideal temperature is between 20°C (68°F) and 22°C (72°F). Use light blankets and adjust them based on the room temperature, ensuring your baby is not wrapped up too much."}
{"question": "How can you tell if your baby is drinking enough milk, and what should you do if you notice orange spots or changes in urine?", "answer": "A baby who is drinking enough milk will urinate regularly, with pale yellow urine and no detectable smell. By day 5, they should wet at least 6 diapers a day. Orange spots (urate crystals) in the diaper during the first few days are normal, but if they persist beyond two days, it may indicate your baby is not drinking enough. If this continues after a week, consult a doctor. If your baby urinates less often, or if the urine appears darker and smells distinct, it could be a sign of dehydration, possibly due to overheating or being overdressed."}
{"question": "What should you expect from your baby's stools, and when should you be concerned?", "answer": "In the first 2 to 3 days, your baby will pass meconium, which is dark and sticky. After that, stools will become yellowish, greenish, or brownish, and should be soft or liquid if your baby is drinking enough milk. During the first 4 to 6 weeks, your baby may have 3 to 10 bowel movements per day. If there is less than one bowel movement per day, it could mean your baby is not getting enough milk. After 4 to 6 weeks, babies fed with breast milk may have fewer bowel movements (e.g., one every 3 to 7 days), and this is normal as long as the stools remain soft. The color, frequency, and consistency of stools can change based on your baby's diet. If your baby's stools become more liquid than usual, it might indicate a temporary issue, but if your baby is healthy, continue feeding normally. If you're concerned, contact a health professional."}
{"question": "What does your baby's crying mean, and how should you respond?", "answer": "Crying is a normal part of a baby's development and is their way of expressing needs. Babies may cry for reasons such as hunger, tiredness, needing a burp, wanting affection, or having a dirty diaper. Crying tends to increase from the second week of life, peaks around the sixth week, and usually decreases by the third or fourth month. While it can be difficult to understand why your baby is crying, you'll gradually learn to recognize the different meanings behind the cries. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you may not know the cause. In those moments, staying calm and comforting your baby teaches them to trust you. It's important to respond quickly, as babies don't have a sense of time in the first few months. Comforting your baby will not spoil them; it shows them that their needs are being met and helps them feel loved. If you need a break, it's okay to place your baby in a safe space while you take some time for yourself."}
{"question": "Why do babies cry excessively, and what can you do?", "answer": "Some babies experience excessive crying, often referred to as colic, where they cry for more than three hours a day, particularly in the late afternoon or evening. During these episodes, the baby may appear to be in pain, with a red face, clenched fists, and curled-up legs. This may be due to gas, as crying can cause babies to swallow air. Colic is a common and normal phase in infancy and is not linked to any underlying health problems. While it can be distressing, it doesn't have any long-term consequences for the baby. As parents, it's important to remain calm during these times and try various soothing methods, such as gentle rocking, swaddling, or offering a pacifier, to comfort your baby. However, if you're concerned about the intensity or duration of the crying, or if other symptoms develop, consulting a healthcare provider is always a good idea."}
{"question": "How can you soothe a crying baby? What are the different techniques that can help calm a baby? If nothing works after trying various methods, what should you do?", "answer": "To soothe a crying baby, ensure her needs are met and check for any concerning signs. You can try calming techniques such as turning down the lights, playing soft music, massaging or touching her, offering your breast for comfort, rocking her, going for a stroller or car ride, giving her a bath, or placing her face down on your forearm in a soothing position. If these methods don't work after several days or if you have concerns, consult a health professional for reassurance and other suggestions. Medications and natural products for \"colic\" are generally not recommended."}
{"question": "How should you handle feeling overwhelmed when your baby is crying excessively? What can you do if you feel frustrated or tired? How can you ensure your baby's safety while taking a break?", "answer": "If you're feeling overwhelmed by your baby's excessive crying, it's normal to feel frustrated or tired. It's helpful to have someone you trust who can take over for a while, allowing you to rest and regain calm. If no one is available, place your baby in a safe space like her crib, step away for a few minutes, and check on her every ten minutes to ensure her safety. Don’t pick her up until you’ve calmed down. Don’t hesitate to seek help from a babysitter, relative, or doctor if needed."}
{"question": "What is a breath-holding spell, and when might it occur? How should you respond if your baby experiences a breath-holding spell? When should you consult a doctor?", "answer": "A breath-holding spell is when a baby cries until they stop breathing for several seconds and briefly lose consciousness, often turning blue or pale. This typically occurs around 6 months of age and is usually harmless. If this happens, remain calm, stay with your baby, and reassure her as she will start breathing again on her own. However, if the spell occurs before 6 months of age or lasts longer than one minute, it’s important to consult a doctor."}
{"question": "Why do newborns have the reflex to suck, and what is the role of pacifiers? Should a baby use a pacifier constantly, and how can it affect their teeth? When should you encourage your child to stop using a pacifier, and how can it affect their speech?", "answer": "Newborns naturally have the reflex to suck, with breastfeeding being the most satisfying option. While not all babies need a pacifier, some may use one for comfort, but it shouldn't be in their mouth all the time. If your baby sucks her thumb or fingers, consider offering a pacifier, as it's easier to control. Prolonged use of a pacifier can affect your child's teeth and pronunciation, so it's best to help them gradually stop around the age of 2 or 3, before adult teeth come in. Avoid using pacifiers to calm your baby too quickly, as it may mask her needs."}
{"question": "How should you choose a pacifier for your baby, and what safety precautions should be taken? What should you do if your baby uses the pacifier for chewing?", "answer": "When choosing a pacifier for your baby, ensure it is appropriate for her age. Opt for either silicone or latex models. If your baby starts using the pacifier for chewing, it's better to offer a teething ring instead. Always ensure the pacifier's disk remains outside her mouth, as chewing on it could cause it to break, posing a choking hazard."}
{"question": "How should you clean and maintain your baby's pacifier, and what safety precautions should be taken? What should you do if the pacifier shows signs of damage?", "answer": "To clean your baby's pacifier, disinfect it according to the manufacturer's instructions before first use, and wash it in hot, soapy water every time your baby uses it. Avoid putting it in your mouth to prevent transferring cavity-causing bacteria. Always check the nipple for flexibility and ensure the disk is securely attached. If the nipple becomes discolored, sticky, cracked, or changes shape, dispose of it immediately to maintain safety."}
{"question": "How does touch benefit your baby, and what are some ways to use it effectively? What are the benefits of massaging your baby, and how can you incorporate it into your routine?", "answer": "Touch is a vital form of communication for newborns, providing comfort and reassurance, and helping them feel loved. Holding your baby close, rocking, and caressing her can calm her and foster a sense of security. Massaging your baby is a great way to bond and promote her physical and emotional well-being. Start by massaging her temples or soles of the feet, using gentle motions that she enjoys. Incorporating a massage during bath time with cream or lotion can enhance the experience and encourage relaxation. Baby massage also supports healthy growth and development."}
{"question": "What are the steps for giving a baby massage, and what should you keep in mind to ensure it’s comfortable for your baby? How can you prepare for a baby massage and make the experience enjoyable for both you and your baby?", "answer": "To give your baby a soothing massage, first choose a time when she is awake and receptive, but not too close to feeding. Ensure the room is warm and comfortable, and sit on the floor for ease of access. Use a firm yet gentle touch with your whole hand to avoid tickling, and apply a small amount of warmed vegetable oil, such as sunflower oil, after testing it on a small part of her skin to check for any allergic reactions. Stay relaxed and attentive, observing your baby’s responses to find what she enjoys most. This approach will help create a calming and bonding experience."}
{"question": "How do newborns experience taste and smell, and how do these senses contribute to their bonding with parents? How does a baby recognize their mother or father through scent, and how does it impact their well-being?", "answer": "Newborns have a developed sense of taste and smell from an early age. They can recognize their mother by her scent, which helps them find the nipple for feeding, providing comfort and satisfaction. The taste of breast milk can change based on the mother's diet. Additionally, when the father holds the baby for the first time, the baby will also recognize the father's scent, promoting early bonding. Skin-to-skin contact between father and child in the first hours after birth enhances this connection."}
{"question": "How does a baby hear at birth, and how does she react to familiar voices or loud noises? What should parents do if they suspect a hearing problem in their baby, and when is it necessary to seek professional help?", "answer": "Newborns can hear from birth and are especially sensitive to their mother and father's voices, as they are familiar with these sounds from the womb. Familiar voices often calm the baby, while loud or sudden noises can startle and upset her. Most babies in Québec have normal hearing, but around six in 1,000 may experience hearing issues. Parents can observe if their baby responds to sounds, like a dog barking or a doorbell ringing, typically by 6 to 9 months. If there's no reaction, it's advisable to consult a doctor for further evaluation. Newborns may also have ears that stick out, but this usually resolves over time."}
{"question": "At what age does a baby start to distinguish light and colors, and when does her field of vision expand to an adult level? How does sight contribute to a baby's communication, and what are some things she can see from birth?", "answer": "At 1 month, a baby can see and respond to light that isn't too bright. By 2 months, she can distinguish colors and follow slow-moving objects or people with her eyes. Around 1 year, her field of vision expands to match that of an adult. From birth, a baby can see faces, shapes, and colors, with a preference for faces and geometric shapes, making sight a crucial way for her to communicate."}
{"question": "What is the safest sleeping position for a newborn, and what conditions should the sleep environment meet? How can you ensure your baby is properly covered during sleep?", "answer": "Newborns should always sleep on their back. Once they can turn over on their own, they can sleep in their preferred position without risk. The sleeping environment should include a firm mattress in a crib, cradle, or bassinet that meets Canadian safety standards. Avoid placing any objects such as pillows, comforters, or bumper pads in the crib. If your baby needs covering, use a light blanket or a sleep sack designed for safe sleep."}
{"question": "Should you sleep with your baby? What are the risks of sleeping with your baby on certain surfaces or when you're impaired? How can you safely share your bed with your baby?", "answer": "It’s not recommended to sleep with your baby, especially on couches or furniture like upholstered chairs, or if you’ve been drinking, taking medication that makes you drowsy, or are extremely tired. In these situations, it’s safer for your baby to sleep in her crib in your room. To safely share your bed, always place your baby on her back, use a firm mattress, remove soft bedding, and ensure there is enough space between the mattress and wall to prevent the baby from getting stuck. Never let your baby sleep alone in an adult bed."}
{"question": "How should you ensure your baby sleeps safely while away from home? What are some alternatives to a crib when traveling? Is it safe to let your baby sleep in a car seat or carrier?", "answer": "When away from home, always ensure your baby sleeps in a safe place. Never put your baby to bed alone in an adult bed or use pillows. If you don't have a crib, a blanket on the floor can be a temporary safe bed for babies under 6 months. A mattress on the floor or a playpen are other options, but avoid adding extra mattresses or padding to a playpen. A car seat or baby carrier is not a safe place for sleeping, especially if you are lying down while wearing the carrier. For walks, place your baby on her back in a stroller with a flat or almost flat backrest, ensuring she is properly strapped in. Baby carriers are also an option for walks but are not suitable for sleeping."}
{"question": "What are the risk factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)? What recommendations help reduce the risk of SIDS?", "answer": "The main risk factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) include exposure to maternal tobacco use or secondhand smoke, sleeping on the stomach, and blankets or bedding that could cover a baby’s face. To reduce the risk of SIDS, ensure your baby sleeps safely, avoid smoking during pregnancy and around the baby, and always put your baby to sleep on her back. Babies who are breastfed and properly vaccinated have a lower risk of SIDS. Additionally, make sure your baby is dressed appropriately for sleep, neither too warm nor too cold. Using a baby monitor does not replace these essential safety precautions."}
{"question": "How can flat head syndrome be prevented in infants? What happens if a baby develops a flat head?", "answer": "Flat head syndrome, or positional plagiocephaly, can occur if a baby remains in the same position, such as in a crib or car seat, for long periods. To prevent this, it’s important to vary the baby's position while awake, as the bones of their skull are still soft and can flatten with pressure. A slight flattening usually disappears on its own, while more pronounced flatness may become permanent, though it won't affect the baby’s brain or development."}
{"question": "What are the sleep patterns of a newborn in the first weeks? Should you wake your baby during agitated sleep?", "answer": "In the first weeks, a newborn’s sleep pattern includes drowsiness, calm sleep, and agitated sleep. During agitated sleep, babies may exhibit movements like sucking, frowning, or even crying. This is normal, and there’s no need to wake them unless they need encouragement to feed. As the weeks pass, babies will stay awake for longer periods."}
{"question": "How much sleep does a baby need at 4 months? Will your baby need to feed at night at this age?", "answer": "At 4 months, babies typically sleep 14 to 15 hours per day and start sleeping longer through the night. Around this time, they begin to develop a more predictable routine and learn to comfort themselves by sucking their hand. Some babies may stop needing nighttime feedings between 4 and 6 months, while others may still need to feed during the night."}
{"question": "How can you establish a bedtime routine for your baby? Should you help your baby fall asleep or let her learn to fall asleep on her own?", "answer": "Establishing a bedtime routine with consistent actions, like a warm bath, a quiet game, a story, and soft music, helps your baby understand when it’s time for bed. There’s no one right way to do it, but sticking to a routine can make bedtime easier. You can choose to rock your baby to sleep or allow her to fall asleep on her own. The key is to feel comfortable with the routine, and once your baby learns to fall asleep on her own, she will be able to self-soothe if she wakes up during the night."}
{"question": "How long do babies typically sleep through the night? What can you do to help your baby distinguish between day and night?", "answer": "Babies’ sleep patterns vary, but \"sleeping through the night\" generally refers to five or six hours of sleep between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. About 70% of 3-month-olds sleep for five hours at night, increasing to 90% by 10 months. To help your baby distinguish between day and night, follow her natural sleep rhythm and keep nighttime feedings calm and quiet by dimming the lights and avoiding conversation."}
{"question": "How much sleep do babies need between 6 and 12 months? Why might a baby start waking up at night, and how can you reassure them?", "answer": "Babies between 6 and 12 months typically sleep 8 to 10 hours at night, totaling around 15 hours of sleep per day. During this period, it is common for babies to start waking up at night due to separation anxiety. When this happens, you can reassure your baby with your voice and touch, which often helps them feel better. It's normal for babies to have wakeful periods, and they can gradually learn to fall asleep on their own."}
{"question": "What should you do if your baby wakes up in the middle of the night and needs help going back to sleep? How can you help your baby learn to go to sleep on her own? What should you do if your baby cries a lot at night?", "answer": "If your baby wakes up in the middle of the night and needs help going back to sleep, she will likely need the same comfort she requires to fall asleep initially, such as breastfeeding, bottle-feeding, or being rocked. To help her learn to go to sleep on her own, you should teach her to fall asleep independently at bedtime by gradually decreasing the amount of time you stay with her each night. If your baby cries frequently at night, check for health issues like fever, and if it's a recurring concern, consult your doctor. If there are no health problems, consider adjusting her bedtime routine to encourage better sleep."}
{"question": "How much sleep does a 1- to 2-year-old child need? How do napping patterns change during this stage? How should you handle your child's mood after waking up?", "answer": "A 1- to 2-year-old child typically sleeps between 8 to 12 hours at night. Before 18 months, children usually need two naps a day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. After 18 months to 2 years, they may transition to just one nap. If your child wakes up in a bad mood, it's important to be patient and give them time to adjust before resuming activities. Remember, each child's sleep needs vary and decrease as they grow."}
{"question": "Why do 1- to 2-year-olds cry at bedtime? How long does separation anxiety last, and how can you handle it? How does a consistent bedtime routine help?", "answer": "Many 1- to 2-year-olds cry at bedtime due to separation anxiety, a normal phase that can last until around 18 months or longer. Their fears make it difficult for them to be apart from you at night. Maintaining a consistent bedtime routine with gentle firmness can help reassure your child, providing comfort and security as they navigate this challenging time."}
{"question": "How do nightmares and night terrors differ? How should parents respond to each? When do these issues typically resolve?", "answer": "Many children start experiencing night terrors around age 1, during which they may scream and cry but remain deeply asleep. You don’t need to wake them unless there’s a risk of injury. Night terrors usually resolve on their own over time. If a child wakes up in a panic, it’s likely a nightmare, and offering reassurance can help them calm down and return to sleep. Nightmares and night terrors typically decrease as the child grows, and there are resources available to help older children manage them."}
{"question": "What qualifies as disturbed sleep in children? What should parents do if they notice these signs?", "answer": "Disturbed sleep in children can be identified by frequent night awakenings (more than twice), long wake periods (over 20 minutes), needing assistance to fall back asleep, waking multiple times a week, or experiencing these issues for at least three months. If these signs persist, it’s advisable to revisit your child’s bedtime routine, and if concerns continue, seeking advice from a health professional or reading about sleep disturbances may be helpful."}
{"question": "How does a child develop confidence? What are some ways to help a baby gain confidence? Why is it important to respond to a baby’s signals? What can happen when a child feels confident in their caregiver? How does separation affect a child’s confidence?", "answer": "A child develops confidence by forming a bond of trust with caregivers who are sensitive to their needs, offering comfort and reassurance, especially when the child is afraid. To help your baby gain confidence, it's important to hold them often, play with them, and learn their personality. Responding to their signals, such as crying or movement, in a prompt and reassuring way will make them feel secure. When a baby has confidence in their caregiver, they feel more secure to explore their surroundings. Sensitive children may take longer to feel confident. Separation from parents may cause anxiety, but once reunited, the child will regain confidence after spending time with their parents."}
{"question": "How can you understand your baby’s temperament? What are the different types of babies based on temperament? How should you handle a sensitive baby or one who is more cautious? What should you do to help a baby focus and learn?", "answer": "Understanding your baby’s temperament involves observing their unique character and behaviors, such as their energy levels, reactions to new experiences, and sensitivity to light, noise, and texture. Babies can be categorized as \"easy,\" \"sensitive,\" or \"cautious.\" \"Easy\" babies follow a regular routine and adapt well to changes. \"Sensitive\" babies may cry a lot and need more care and patience, as they don’t easily adapt to new things. \"Cautious\" babies are calm, take time to adjust, and seem more independent. Regardless of their temperament, it’s essential to provide consistent care and engage with your child at their pace, whether that means helping them focus with quiet activities or encouraging their exploration through physical play."}
